A 67-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to worsening left foot pain. The pain involves the entire left foot and is severe in the forefoot. The pain began a day prior while the patient was lying in bed watching television. He immediately sat up and dangled his foot over the side of the bed, but this did not improve the pain as it had during past episodes. Although the pain was initially mild, it progressively worsened over the course of the day. The patient tried heat packs and over-the-counter pain medication, which he takes intermittently for chronic low back pain, without relief. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient smokes 1-2 packs of cigarettes daily. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 146/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min. On examination, the skin of both lower legs is shiny and hairless, and the left foot is mottled and cooler to the touch than the right foot. Pulses are not palpable in either foot but can be detected with doppler in the right foot. The left foot has capillary refill of 4-5 seconds. The patient has difficulty moving his left foot and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's new symptoms?

A 67-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to worsening left foot pain. The pain involves the entire left foot and is severe in the forefoot. The pain began a day prior while the patient was lying in bed watching television. He immediately sat up and dangled his foot over the side of the bed, but this did not improve the pain as it had during past episodes. Although the pain was initially mild, it progressively worsened over the course of the day. The patient tried heat packs and over-the-counter pain medication, which he takes intermittently for chronic low back pain, without relief. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient smokes 1-2 packs of cigarettes daily. Temperature is 36. 7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 146/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min. On examination, the skin of both lower legs is shiny and hairless, and the left foot is mottled and cooler to the touch than the right foot. Pulses are not palpable in either foot but can be detected with doppler in the right foot. The left foot has capillary refill of 4-5 seconds. The patient has difficulty moving his left foot and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's new symptoms?

✓ O

A. Atherosclerotic plaque disruption (78°/o)

Explanation

This patient likely has peripheral artery disease (PAD) given his risk factors (eg, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), symptoms (eg, rest pain that improved with dangling), and clinical findings (eg, shiny, hairless legs). In patients with PAD, atherosclerosis of peripheral arteries (eg, popliteal artery) may be complicated by plaque disruption. This can lead to thrombosis and acute-on-chronic limb ischemia (eg, mottling, coolness, prolonged capillary refill, paresis).

B. Exaggerated cutaneous vasoreactivity (0%)

C. Increased compartmental pressure (6%)

D. Popliteal vein thrombosis (5%)

E. Tobacco-associated vasculitis (8%)

In contrast to patients without PAD who develop acute limb ischemia (eg, due to arterial embolus from atrial fibrillation) and typically have abrupt onset of the classic 6 Ps of ischemia, those with existing PAD who develop acute-on-chronic limb ischemia (eg, due to thrombosis from plaque disruption) often lack these classic features or develop them more slowly (eg, over 1 day, as in this patient). This is because preexisting collateral circulation, which formed in response to progressive accumulation of atherosclerosis in the primary arterial circulation (eg, popliteal artery), can supply some perfusion to the affected distal limb, as in this patient with prolonged but not absent capillary refill. Even with collateral circulation, distal limb perfusion is still typically inadequate; therefore, most patients with acute-on-chronic limb ischemia require emergency intervention (eg, intravenous heparin infusion, thrombolysis, thrombectomy).

(Choice B) Exaggerated cutaneous vasoreactivity is seen in Raynaud phenomenon and may cause skin color changes. However, vasoconstriction is typically triggered by cold, is more common in the hands, and usually lasts minutes not hours.

Explanation

Cardiovascular contraindications to pregnancy

• Symptomatic mitral stenosis

• Symptomatic aortic stenosis

Highest risk conditions*

• Symptomatic heart failure with LVEF <30%

• Pulmonary arterial hypertension

• Bicuspid AV with ascending aorta enlargement >50 mm

* Pregnancy contraindicated unless condition is corrected. AV = aortic valve; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction.

The hemodynamic changes of pregnancy involve an increase in blood volume and up to a 50% increase in cardiac output by the second trimester. These changes can be poorly tolerated in the setting of valvular disease, placing both the mother and unborn infant at substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. Stenotic valvular disease is generally more poorly tolerated than regurgitant valvular disease.

Mitral stenosis usually occurs due to rheumatic heart disease and is a common cause of pregnancy-related complications that include:

• Decompensated heart failure with elevated left atrial pressure and pulmonary edema

• Atrial fibrillation (due to left atrial stretching)

2023

Version

• Increased risk of left atrial thromboembolism (due to stagnant left atrial blood flow and the underlying hypercoagulable state of pregnancy)

This patient has severe mitral stenosis (valve area s1 .5 cm ) 2 with associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea on exertion). Symptomatic mitral stenosis is among the highest-risk cardiac conditions during pregnancy and is a contraindication to taking pregnancy to term; therefore, valve repair (eg, percutaneous mitral intervention) should be performed prior to pregnancy whenever possible.

Symptomatic mitral stenosis is among the highest-risk cardiac conditions during pregnancy and is a contraindication to taking pregnancy to term; therefore, valve repair (eg, percutaneous mitral intervention) should be performed prior to pregnancy whenever possible.

Although less common than mitral stenosis in women of childbearing age, symptomatic aortic stenosis is also one of the highest-risk cardiac conditions during pregnancy and should be surgically corrected prior to pregnancy.

(Choice A) Lifelong avoidance of pregnancy is recommended in patients with a highest-risk condition that is not amenable to correction, often including pulmonary arterial hypertension and symptomatic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction <30%.

(Choices C and D) Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy is minimally invasive and is the preferred surgical intervention for mitral stenosis. Open mitral valve repair or replacement is pursued when the valve is not amenable to percutaneous intervention (eg, valvotomy would cause severe mitral regurgitation). However, interventions should happen prior to pregnancy.

(Choice E) Beta blockers slow heart rate to increase left ventricular filling time and reduce left atrial pressure and may be used to manage relatively mild mitral stenosis during pregnancy. Medical management is also often appropriate for other relatively lower-risk valvular diseases (eg, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation) during pregnancy; however, it is inadequate to prevent complications for symptomatic mitral stenosis, and surgical repair is needed.

Educational objective:

The increase in blood volume and cardiac output associated with pregnancy can be poorly tolerated in the setting of valvular disease. Symptomatic mitral stenosis is among the highestrisk conditions during pregnancy; therefore, surgical repair, preferably with percutaneous intervention, should be performed prior to pregnancy.

A 73-year-old man comes to the physician because of right anterior thigh pain that is worse with walking. He has a history of stable angina, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and COPD with periodic exacerbations. He takes ipratropium, aspirin, metoprolol and pravastatin. He smokes 2 packs a day and drinks alcohol occasionally. Physical examination shows a small pulsatile mass in the right groin area. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Explanation

The clinical scenario described is consistent with a femoral artery aneurysm. A pulsatile groin mass below the inguinal ligament is characteristic; anterior thigh pain is due to the compression of the femoral nerve that runs lateral to the artery. Femoral artery aneurysm is the second most common peripheral artery aneurysm after popliteal aneurysm. It may be associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Peripheral artery aneurysm manifests as a pulsatile mass that can compress adjacent structures (nerves, veins), and can result in thrombosis and ischemia. Popliteal and femoral artery aneurysms are the most common peripheral artery aneurysms. They are frequently associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms.

A 76-year-old man is admitted to the coronary care unit after an episode of substernal chest pain. His other medical problems include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has a history of a diverticular bleed 2 years ago. After initial workup, cardiac catheterization is performed and shows 70% left main coronary artery stenosis, 90°/o proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis, and 80% right coronary artery stenosis. Antiplatelet agents are stopped, and the patient is continued on a heparin drip in preparation for coronary artery bypass surgery the next day. Five hours after the catheterization, his blood pressure is 75/60 mm Hg and pulse is 120/min and regular. He complains of some generalized weakness and back pain but denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and abdominal discomfort. On physical examination, he appears diaphoretic and clammy. Neck veins are flat. Heart sounds are normal, and the chest is clear to auscultation. The right groin arterial puncture site is mildly tender, without any swelling or bruits. He receives 1000 ml of normal saline with symptomatic improvement. His blood pressure is 96/60 mm Hg and pulse is 85/min. His repeat ECG is unchanged from the initial ECG at presentation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?

Q A. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast (39%) Q B. CT scan of chest with contrast (16%)

✓

Explanation

This patient's presentation (recent cardiac catheterization, anticoagulation with heparin, sudden onset of hypotension, tachycardia, flat neck veins, and back pain) is consistent with retroperitoneal hematoma due to bleeding from the arterial access site (with retroperitoneal extension). Local vascular complications at the catheter insertion site - bleeding, hematoma (localized or with retroperitoneal extension), arterial dissection, acute thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula formation - are the most common complications of cardiac catheterization. Most hemorrhage or hematoma formation occurs within 12 hours of catheterization.

Patients with hematoma present with localized discomfort and/or swelling of the soft tissue. If the arterial puncture site is above the inguinal ligament, the hematoma can extend into the retroperitoneal space, even with minimal visible localized hematoma, and present with sudden hemodynamic instability and ipsilateral flank or back pain. Diagnosis is confirmed with CT scan of abdomen and pelvis or abdominal ultrasound. Treatment is usually supportive, with intensive monitoring, bed rest, and intravenous fluids or blood transfusion. Surgical repair of hematomas or retroperitoneal hemorrhage is rarely required.

Q Q Q

C. Nasogastric tube placement (1%)

D. Stat transthoracic echocardiogram (29%)

E. Urgent coronary artery bypass surgery (12%)

Since local hematoma formation is not uncommon, patients should be advised to avoid strenuous activity or lifting heavy objects for one week post catheterization. Radial artery approach leads to fewer local vascular complications, which has led to an increasing number of cardiac catheterizations being performed via this approach.

(Choice B) CT scan of chest with contrast can reliably identify acute thoracic aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is an extremely rare complication of diagnostic cardiac catheterization, and usually occurs in the right coronary sinus due to coronary engagement with non-conventional catheters. This patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with retroperitoneal hematoma.

~ 2023

~ Version

(Choice C) Nasogastric tubes may be used to differentiate between upper and lower sources of gastrointestinal bleeding, to detect ongoing bleeding (red blood in lavage), and to remove particulate matter, or blood clots to facilitate endoscopy. This patient does not have any signs or symptoms suggestive of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

A 76-year-old man is admitted to the coronary care unit after an episode of substernal chest pain. His other medical problems include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has a history of a diverticular bleed 2 years ago. After initial workup, cardiac catheterization is performed and shows 70% left main coronary artery stenosis, 90°/o proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis, and 80% right coronary artery stenosis. Antiplatelet agents are stopped, and the patient is continued on a heparin drip in preparation for coronary artery bypass surgery the next day. Five hours after the catheterization, his blood pressure is 75/60 mm Hg and pulse is 120/min and regular. He complains of some generalized weakness and back pain but denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and abdominal discomfort. On physical examination, he appears diaphoretic and clammy. Neck veins are flat. Heart sounds are normal, and the chest is clear to auscultation. The right groin arterial puncture site is mildly tender, without any swelling or bruits. He receives 1000 ml of normal saline with symptomatic improvement. His blood pressure is 96/60 mm Hg and pulse is 85/min. His repeat ECG is unchanged from the initial ECG at presentation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?

✓ O

A. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast (39%)

Since local hematoma formation is not uncommon, patients should be advised to avoid strenuous activity or lifting heavy objects for one week post catheterization. Radial artery approach leads to fewer local vascular complications, which has led to an increasing number of cardiac catheterizations being performed via this approach.

(Choice B) CT scan of chest with contrast can reliably identify acute thoracic aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is an extremely rare complication of diagnostic cardiac catheterization, and usually occurs in the right coronary sinus due to coronary engagement with non-conventional catheters. This patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with retroperitoneal hematoma.

(Choice C) Nasogastric tubes may be used to differentiate between upper and lower sources of gastrointestinal bleeding, to detect ongoing bleeding (red blood in lavage), and to remove particulate matter, or blood clots to facilitate endoscopy. This patient does not have any signs or symptoms suggestive of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

(Choice D) A stat transthoracic echocardiogram is helpful in the diagnosis of pericardia! effusion and cardiac tamponade. Patients with cardiac tamponade would be expected to have distended jugular veins (and not flat neck veins as noted in this patient).

Retroperitoneal hematoma can occur as a local vascular complication of cardiac catheterization, and often presents with sudden hemodynamic instability and ipsilateral flank or back pain. Diagnosis is confirmed with CT scan of abdomen and pelvis or abdominal ultrasonography. Treatment is usually supportive with bed rest, intensive monitoring, and intravenous fluids and/or blood transfusion.

Explanation

Cardiac tamponade

• Blood in pericardia! space (eg, LV rupture, cardiac surgery)

Etiology

• Pericardia! effusion (eg, malignancy, infection, uremia)

Clinical signs

Diagnosis

Treatment

• Beck triad: hypotension, JVD, t heart sounds

• Pulsus paradoxus: SBP t >10 mm Hg during inspiration

• ECG: low-voltage QRS complex, electrical alternans

• Chest x-ray: enlarged cardiac silhouette,* clear lungs

• Echocardiography: right atrial & ventricular collapse, IVC plethora

• Intravenous fluids to increase right-sided preload

• Drainage via pericardiocentesis or pericardia! window

*Subacute but not acute tamponade.

IVC = inferior vena cava; JVD = jugular venous distension; LV = left ventricular; SBP = systolic blood pressure.

IVC = inferior vena cava; JVD = jugular venous distension; LV = left ventricular; SBP = systolic blood pressure.

This patient has Beck triad (hypotension, jugular venous distension, distant heart sounds) and low-amplitude QRS complexes on ECG, findings consistent with cardiac tamponade. Acute tamponade is a potential complication of cardiac procedures (eg, ablation), which may cause bleeding into the pericardia! space.

2023

Version

As blood or fluid fills the low-compliance pericardia! sac, pericardia! pressure increases and compresses the cardiac chambers; the relatively low-pressure right-sided chambers are primarily affected, with restricted diastolic filling of the right atrium and right ventricle. As these chambers are unable to fill, less blood is pumped to the left side of the heart and cardiac index (Cl) (a measure of cardiac output per body surface area) decreases, resulting in hypotension and obstructive shock. Because the obstruction to blood flow is primarily right-

' hypotension and obstructive shock. Because the obstruction to blood flow is primarily rightsided, an absence of pulmonary edema is expected.

Due to compression by the accumulating pericardia! fluid, right atrial pressure (RAP) (a reflection of central venous pressure) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) (a reflection of left atrial pressure) are increased. As tamponade progresses, diastolic pressures in all 4 cardiac chambers increase and equalize with pericardial pressure (and with one another), stagnating blood flow within the heart.

(Choice A) Hypovolemic shock involves decreased RAP, PCWP, and Cl. In response to the low Cl, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increases to try to maintain blood pressure.

(Choice B) Obstructive shock due to acute pulmonary embolism involves increased RAP (proximal to the obstruction) and decreased PCWP and Cl (distal to the obstruction). SVR is increased in response to low Cl. Tamponade represents a unique scenario in which PCWP is elevated despite decreased blood flow to the left atrium.

(Choice C) Septic shock involves peripheral vasodilation with decreased SVR and decreased RAP. PCWP is also decreased. Cl is increased because of sympathetic activation in response to the reduced SVR.

(Choice E) A marked decrease in SVR is the initial disturbance in high-output heart failure, and a compensatory rise in Cl increases venous return (increased RAP). Despite a sustained increase in Cl, left ventricular output cannot keep up with the increased flow demand created by reduced SVR and heart failure develops (eg, increased PCWP).

2023

Version

Cardiac tamponade may be recognized by Beck triad (hypotension, jugular venous distension, distant heart sounds). Increasing pericardia! pressure restricts diastolic filling of the right-sided heart chambers, leading to decreased cardiac output and obstructive shock. Right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (a reflection of left atrial pressure) are increased due to compression.

hemodynamically stable and his chest x-ray and extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (eFAST) are normal. The next step is to obtain an ECG to screen for blunt cardiac injury (BCI).

For patients with blunt chest trauma, hemodynamic stability or instability determines the management strategy. Hemodynamically unstable patients undergo simultaneous resuscitation and evaluation (eg, chest x-ray, eFAST, ECG) to look for life-threatening injuries. Stabilizing interventions are performed for any abnormalities identified (eg, chest tube for pneumothorax).

• In stabilized patients, additional tests (eg, chest CT scan) are obtained to assess for further injuries that could be missed on initial evaluation (eg, aortic injury).

• Patients who remain unstable are taken directly for operating room thoracotomy.

(Choice A) BCI frequently causes sinus tachycardia; however, beta blockers, which reduce both heart rate and myocardial contractility, are not routinely administered because BCI also often causes myocardial edema with decreased contractility, which can lead to hypotension. In addition, sinus tachycardia is often a physiologic response that should be managed by addressing the underlying cause rather than by beta blockade (which blunts the response).

This patient's progressive exertional dyspnea and early diastolic sound (ie, opening snap) followed by a rumbling diastolic murmur are consistent with mitral stenosis (MS). MS usually occurs in the setting of underlying rheumatic heart disease; in the United States it is most frequently seen in patients who emigrated from Latin America, Africa, or Asia. Progressive dyspnea on exertion is the most common presenting symptom.

The hemodynamic alterations that occur with MS result from restricted diastolic filling of the left ventricle. As the severity of the stenosis worsens, there is increased left atrial pressure that leads to left atrial dilation. Consequent increased pulmonary artery (PA) pressures (systolic and diastolic) then occur via 2 mechanisms:

• The passive (or postcapillary) component of pulmonary hypertension is most prominent and results from transmission of elevated pressure backward from the left atrium to the pulmonary veins, pulmonary capillaries, and pulmonary arteries. Clinically, this

Recently, the patient has barely been able to walk a block without becoming out of breath. Occasionally, she becomes dyspneic even at rest. She has noticed puffiness of both ankles at the end of the day. The patient denies any palpitations, chest pain, weight loss, lightheadedness, or syncope. She emigrated from India at age 25. Medical history is unremarkable. On physical examination, the patient appears comfortable. Blood pressure is 131/78 mm Hg and pulse is 86/min and regular. With the patient on her left side, an early diastolic heart sound is heard followed by a diastolic rumble. Which of the following are the most likely hemodynamic findings in this patient?

Correct answer

• The passive (or postcapillary) component of pulmonary hypertension is most prominent and results from transmission of elevated pressure backward from the left atrium to the pulmonary veins, pulmonary capillaries, and pulmonary arteries. Clinically, this process is typically evidenced by pulmonary edema and its associated symptoms (eg, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, hemoptysis), as well as peripheral edema.

• The reactive (or precapillary) component of pulmonary hypertension is only sometimes present and occurs independent of left atrial pressure. In this process, MS triggers endothelin-mediated pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction and pathologic vascular remodeling through a poorly understood mechanism.

Left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure is generally unaffected in MS as the left ventricle is downstream of the pathologic stenosis. In severe MS, LV diastolic pressure may be lower than normal.

(Choice A) Increased LV diastolic and PA systolic and diastolic pressures occur in pulmonary hypertension that is secondary to LV failure (Group 2 pulmonary hypertension). MS is a unique cause of Group 2 pulmonary hypertension in that LV diastolic pressure remains normal.

(Choice C) Reduced pulmonary arterial compliance, as occurs with age, increases PA systolic pressure and has little effect on PA and LV diastolic pressures.

(Choice D) Increased LV diastolic pressure with normal PA pressures occurs in early LV failure, before the elevated pressures are transmitted back to the pulmonary circulation and clinical decompensation occurs.

(Choice E) Normal PA pressures are not expected in this patient with symptomatic evidence of advanced MS (eg, severe dyspnea on exertion, peripheral edema).

The expected hemodynamic alterations of mitral stenosis are elevated pulmonary artery pressures with normal left ventricular pressures. The pulmonary hypertension is primarily passive, resulting from transmission of elevated left atrial pressure backward to the pulmonary circulation. There may also be a reactive component involving endothelin-mediated pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction and remodeling.

A 58-year-old computer engineer is evaluated for a murmur heard during a routine physical. He has no symptoms and no significant medical history. Specifically, he has no dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or lower extremity swelling. The patient smokes a cigar and drinks a glass of brandy every Friday night. His lifestyle is mostly sedentary, but he walks for several miles on weekends. Blood pressure is 122/69 mm Hg and pulse is 72/min. There is no jugular venous distension. Vesicular breath sounds are auscultated bilaterally. There is a 3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex.

Correct answer

*When possible, durable valve repair is favored over replacement because replacement necessitates lifelong anticoagulation & repeat replacement is often needed after ~10 yr.

LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; MR= mitral regurgitation.

Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is that caused by an intrinsic defect of the mitral valve apparatus (eg, leaflets, chordae tendineae) and is differentiated from secondary MR, which results from other cardiac disease (eg, myocardial ischemia, dilated cardiomyopathy). This patient's echocardiogram reveals severe MR due to mitral valve prolapse, a primary defect resulting from myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve (manifesting on echocardiography as mitral valve cusps bulging into the left atrium during systole).

Chronic, severe primary MR is best treated with surgical repair, and the timing of surgery should precede the development of significant LV dysfunction. An important consideration is that measured LV ejection fraction (LVEF) overestimates LV function in severe MR because regurgitant flow accounts for a large amount of the stroke volume. Therefore, LVEF 30%-60% (as in this patient) is an indication for surgical repair (or replacement if repair is not possible) in patients with primary chronic severe MR, regardless of symptoms.

Because a progressive decline in LV function is expected in all patients, preemptive surgery should be considered in asymptomatic patients with LVEF >60% who are excellent candidates for successful valve repair (rather than replacement). Symptomatic patients with LVEF <30% have likely progressed to life-limiting, permanent systolic dysfunction; therefore, surgery is considered only when there is a high likelihood of successful valve repair.

A 72-year-old man underwent surgical repair of an aneurysm of the infrarenal aorta. He received perioperative prophylaxis with a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. On the first postoperative day he complains of progressive abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. His temperature is 38.5° C (101 ° F), blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min and respirations are 22/min. His abdomen is mildly distended and tender to palpation. The tenderness is mostly in the left lower quadrant without rebound. Femoral pulses are full and symmetric. His white blood cell count is 12,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Explanation

Bowel ischemia is one known complication (1-7% incidence) of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. It results from inadequate colonic collateral arterial perfusion to the left and sigmoid colon after loss of the inferior mesenteric artery during aortic graft placement. Patients present with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Fever and leukocytosis may also be present. This adverse effect can be minimized by checking sigmoid colon perfusion following placement of the aortic graft.

Pseudomembranous colitis occurs following antibiotic treatment and most commonly causes a voluminous watery diarrhea in addition to abdominal pain and fever. Bloody diarrhea is rare. Also, it is uncommon to develop C. difficile infection so early after the antibiotic use (typically takes 4-5 days).

A 76-year-old man comes for outpatient follow-up after recent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. He has abundant, yellowish wound discharge from the lower part of the surgical midsternal wound. The patient has no chest pain, dyspnea, fevers, or abdominal swelling. He underwent uncomplicated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery for severe coronary artery disease 9 days ago, which included internal thoracic artery harvesting. Medical history also includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient is afebrile, and vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, the sternum appears stable to palpation. There is swelling and soft tissue separation at the lower part of the wound with copious discharge. Which of the following is the next best step in managing this patient?

Q A. Chest and sternal imaging (35%) Q B. Intensive glucose control and observation (9%)

✓

Explanation

This patient, who recently underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), has evidence of separation of the sternal wound (dehiscence). Wound dehiscence after CABG is a relatively common complication, and management is determined by the extent of tissue involvement.

• Soft tissue dehiscence occurs when only the superficial tissues (eg, skin, muscle) separate. There are no signs of sternal instability or systemic illness; local wound care or debridement followed by primary closure is indicated.

• Sternal dehiscence occurs with separation of the edges of the approximated sternum and may occur with or without soft tissue dehiscence. Sternal instability and nonunion is characterized by "clicking" or "rocking" on sternal palpation. It is a surgical emergency and requires sternal rewiring to prevent cardiac trauma.

A high-mortality complication of dehiscence is deep tissue infection (mediastinitis), due to either contiguous spread of superficial infection or intraoperative deep tissue contamination. Although it classically presents with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, tachycardia), chest pain, chest wall edema/crepitus, and purulent wound discharge, atypical presentations can occur; therefore, any patient with significant sternal wound drainage should be evaluated with chest and sternal imaging (eg, mediastinal fluid collections or pneumomediastinum on CT scan). Management includes emergency surgical debridement, tissue cultures, and empiric intravenous antibiotics.

Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be initiated if mediastinitis is suspected, but in this hemodynamically stable patient with no signs of sternal instability, imaging and cultures should be pursued first to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.

Version

This patient's holosystolic murmur and thrill along the left sternal border are consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). After birth, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) begins to decline, with the right ventricle contracting against PVR and the left ventricle contracting against the relatively higher systemic vascular resistance. This pressure differential between the right- and left-sided chambers of the heart causes left-to-right shunting via the VSD.

Small VSDs are usually hemodynamically insignificant due to a small volume of shunted blood. However, a larger VSD leads to volume overload and dilation of the right ventricle. The excess volume is then pumped through the lungs and delivered to the left atrium. This increased left atrial preload leads to left atrial and ventricular chamber enlargement, seen on chest x-ray as an enlarged left heart contour.

Presentation of VSD ranges from asymptomatic in patients with small VSDs to acute heart

A 1-month-old girl is brought to the office for a routine well-child visit. The patient has no symptoms and is feeding well. Weight and length are stable at the 45th percentile. Pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 35/min. Oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. She is breathing comfortably without retractions or grunting. There is no cyanosis. Jugular venous pressure is not elevated. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur and a systolic thrill are present at the left lower sternal border. Blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg in her right arm and 78/38 mm Hg in her right leg. A chest x-ray reveals an enlarged left heart contour. What is the most likely cause of this patient's x-ray findings?

Presentation of VSD ranges from asymptomatic in patients with small VSDs to acute heart failure in the neonatal period or infancy in patients with moderate to large VSDs. This infant with radiographic evidence of left-sided chamber enlargement likely has a relatively large VSD; she will likely develop signs of heart failure (eg, increased work of breathing, failure to thrive) due to continued pulmonary overcirculation and biventricular volume overload.

(Choice A) Asymmetric septal hypertrophy describes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a diagnosis rarely made during infancy. Left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction causes a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, and septal enlargement has minimal effect on the cardiac appearance on x-ray.

C. Increased left atrial preload (44%)

D. Left ventricular inflow obstruction (7%)

E. Right-to-left intracardiac shunting (27%)

(Choice B) Decreased LV contractility with reduced cardiac output (ie, low-output heart failure) can cause left-sided volume overload with an enlarged left heart contour on chest x-ray. However, with VSD, LV contractility and cardiac output are maintained, and high-output heart failure occurs due to inability of the LV to keep up with the increased venous return from the pulmonary circulation.

Omitted

Correct answer

C

(Choice D) LV inflow obstruction (ie, mitral stenosis) is a rare congenital abnormality. Mitral stenosis causes left atrial enlargement with straightening of the upper left heart border on chest x-ray, and a diastolic (not systolic) murmur is expected.

Educational objective:

A ventricular septal defect causes a holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border due to left-toright intracardiac shunting. Right ventricular volume overload leads to increased left atrial preload and enlargement of both the right ventricle and left-sided chambers. Chest x-ray typically reveals an enlarged left heart contour.

A 64-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 2 days of fevers, chills, and positional chest pain. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage kidney disease. The patient undergoes hemodialysis 3 times a week but missed his last session because he did not feel well. Temperature is 39.2 C (102.6 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min and irregular, and respirations are 20/min. The patient appears unwell and uncomfortable. Examination shows clear lungs, distant heart sounds, no heart murmurs, and minimal lower extremity edema. The dialysis catheter site appears clean without erythema or purulence. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Blood leukocytes are 25,000/mm 3 with 80% neutrophils. ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and low-amplitude QRS complexes. Chest x-ray reveals normal lung fields. Bedside echocardiography reveals normal left and right ventricular function, no significant valvular disease, and a moderate pericardia! effusion with no evidence of tamponade. Blood cultures are obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

• CXR: enlarged cardiac silhouette & clear lung fields

• Echocardiography: pericardia! effusion

• Cytology: turbid fluid with j WBCs (neutrophil predominant), j protein, t glucose

• Intravenous antibiotics+ pericardia! drainage

CXR = chest x-ray; WBCs = white blood cells.

This patient has fever, chills, leukocytosis with left shift, new arrhythmia, and a pericardia! effusion on echocardiography. This presentation is most concerning for purulent pericarditis.

Purulent pericarditis is an acute febrile illness resulting from bacterial infection (or fungal infection) of the pericardium. The most common cause is Staphylococcus aureus secondary to hematogenous spread of bacteria to the pericardium (via the bloodstream). Chronic hemodialysis, which is associated with fluid shifts and bacteremia, places patients at increased risk. Other causes include direct spread from an intrathoracic infection (eg, pneumonia) and inoculation of bacteria into the pericardium during cardiothoracic surgery.

Blood cultures are obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Purulent pericarditis is rapidly progressive and highly fatal; hence, prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary (Choice 8).

Affected patients typically have systemic symptoms (eg, fever, chills, fatigue) and chest pain and appear severely ill on examination. Tachycardia is typical, and sometimes, new arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation) can occur due to epicardial inflammation and irritation. Pericardial effusion commonly develops due to exudative fluid buildup in the pericardia! space and can lead to distant heart sounds and low-voltage QRS complexes on ECG. Chest x-ray may show an enlarged cardiac silhouette with clear lung fields. Cardiac tamponade can sometimes develop.

Echocardiography confirms pericardia! effusion but cannot distinguish whether it is purulent. Therefore, when purulent pericarditis is suspected, urgent pericardiocentesis is indicated for both confirmation of the diagnosis and treatment (removal of infectious fluid). Purulent fluid is usually turbid due to a high leukocyte count (neutrophil predominant), and Gram stain and culture often reveal the causative organism to guide antibiotic therapy.

(Choice A) Ibuprofen and colchicine are used to treat idiopathic or viral pericarditis. These conditions can cause pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, and, sometimes, fever; a small pericardia! effusion may be seen. However, this patient's toxic appearance, marked leukocytosis, and relatively significant effusion (enlarged cardiac silhouette, low-voltage QRS complexes) make purulent pericarditis more likely.

(Choice D) Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography for detecting infective endocarditis. Acute endocarditis may present similarly to purulent pericarditis (eg, high fever, leukocytosis), but purulent pericarditis is more likely in this patient with distant heart sounds and an absent cardiac murmur.

Educational objective:

Purulent pericarditis is an acute, rapidly fatal infection most commonly caused by hematogenous spread of Staphylococcus aureus. Urgent echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis is essential for confirmation of the diagnosis and treatment.

A previously healthy 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a bicycle crash. The patient was mountain biking downhill when he struck a prominent tree root and was thrown from his bike. He tried to brace his fall with his hands, but his chest struck a large rock as he landed. He did not hit his head or lose consciousness. The patient has moderate central chest pain and severe right wrist pain. Blood pressure is 142/86 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical examination is significant for sternal bruising with point tenderness, abrasions on both palms, and a deformed right wrist with an overlying laceration. Breath sounds, heart sounds, and abdominal examination are normal. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma is negative for free intraabdominal or pericardia! fluid. Noncontrast CT scan of the chest reveals a hairline sternal fracture. Radiographs of the right wrist reveal a severely displaced, open fracture of the right distal radius. The patient is hospitalized for operative irrigation, debridement, and fixation of the wrist fracture. Throughout the day, the patient is noted to be persistently tachycardic even though he is afebrile and normotensive, with normal respirations and oxygen saturation. Pain control is adequate. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with frequent premature ventricular contractions. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

This patient who sustained blunt chest trauma ( eg, sternal fracture from the chest striking a rock) has persistent tachycardia and new arrhythmia (frequent premature ventricular contractions), both of which are concerning for blunt cardiac injury (BCI). BCI can induce myocardial edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis capable of causing a spectrum of structural, ischemic, and electrical complications. The electrical disturbances are frequently subtle and asymptomatic, as in this patient, but they require further monitoring and evaluation because they may be a sign of more severe cardiac sequelae.

Patients with findings concerning for BCI require 24-48 hours of continuous cardiac monitoring because most life-threatening arrythmias occur during that time. In patients with significant findings (eg, arrythmias, hypotension, heart failure), echocardiography is performed to evaluate for myocardial dysfunction and/or structural (eg, valvular) injuries. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE} but is also more invasive; therefore, in this nonintubated, hemodynamically stable patient, transthoracic echocardiography is the best next step.

ECG shows sinus tachycardia with frequent premature ventricular contractions. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

(Choice A) Coronary angiography is appropriate for suspected acute coronary syndrome, which can be caused by traumatic coronary dissection or thrombosis. However, acute coronary syndrome is less likely in patients without ischemic changes (eg, ST-segment changes) on ECG.

(Choice B) CT pulmonary angiography can diagnose pulmonary embolism, a possible complication of trauma due to the inflammatory prothrombotic state. In contrast to this patient, those with pulmonary embolism often have tachypnea, dyspnea, and/or hypoxemia.

(Choice C) Esophagography with water-soluble contrast is the best initial study for suspected esophageal rupture. Although spillage of gastrointestinal contents from esophageal rupture can cause a systemic inflammatory response that includes tachycardia, the systemic inflammatory response typically causes fever, which is not seen in this patient.

(Choice D) Open fractures have increased infection risk compared with closed fractures, and the standard of care involves immediate (<3 hr postinjury) intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and urgent (<6 hr) surgical irrigation and debridement. Although open fractures can cause bacteremia, local infection (eg, soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis) is much more common, and peripheral blood cultures are not typically drawn, especially in the absence of fever.

Patients age >60 years, smokers, men, and those with a history of atherosclerosis or connective tissue diseases are at increased risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which typically causes few symptoms until it markedly expands or ruptures. Pain is the most common initial manifestation and can vary according to aneurysm location. Proximal aneurysms tend to present with upper abdominal, flank, or back pain, whereas distal lesions present with lower abdominal or groin pain. In the event of rupture, hemorrhage usually occurs into the retroperitoneum; because the expanding hematoma may be temporarily contained within the retroperitoneum, patients may remain hemodynamically stable and have a delayed presentation, as in this case.

Other clues to the diagnosis of AAA include a pulsatile abdominal mass (present in slightly over half of patients) and prevertebral aortic calcification on plain x-ray, consistent with extensive atherosclerosis. In symptomatic patients who are hemodynamically stable, the diagnosis should be confirmed with abdominal CT. Hemodynamically unstable patients require emergency surgical repair with confirmation obtained by rapid bedside ultrasound if necessary.

(Choice B) Patients with evidence of musculoskeletal back pain (eg, inciting event, worsened with movement) or lumbar radiculopathy (eg, positive straight leg raise) can be managed conservatively with ibuprofen and rest. However, this patient's unprovoked, sudden-onset lower back pain in the setting of prevertebral calcifications and multiple risk factors for AAA necessitates further investigation.

A 72-year-old man is evaluated on day 2 after a coronary artery bypass graft surgery for severe coronary artery disease. He has no new symptoms except for mild sternal wound discomfort exacerbated by deep breathing. The patient's surgery was uncomplicated; he was extubated on postoperative day 1. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. He is afebrile. Blood pressure is 122/75 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min and regular, and respirations are 16/min. Oxygen saturation is 98°/oon room air. The sternal wound appears to be healing normally. Breath sounds are decreased at the left base. There is no abdominal distension or peripheral edema. Chest x-ray reveals a small, left-sided pleural effusion. Leukocyte count is 9,200/mm 3 and serum creatinine is 1.1 mg/dl. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

Pleural effusions occur in almost half of patients who undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Most are small, asymptomatic, and benign effusions that usually develop on the left side and are the result of the body's reaction to surgical incision of the pleura, disruption of mediastinal lymphatic channels, cardiac cooling, or postoperative pericarditis. Post-cardiac surgery effusions that meet the following criteria (as in this patient) can be managed conservatively with observation only:

• Small to moderate in size and not enlarging

• Early onset (postoperative day 1 or 2)

0

A. Chest tube placement (1%)

C. Diagnostic thoracentesis (10%)

D. Intravenous furosemide (2%)

E. Oral antibiotics (2%)

• Not associated with respiratory symptoms

(Choices A and C) The initial management of large, progressively expansive, or symptomatic pleural effusions should involve diagnostic thoracentesis and fluid analysis. Chest tube placement may be necessary for large effusions or some effusions of infectious etiology; tube placement is also sometimes used in the management of hemothorax or pneumothorax.

(Choices D and E) Antibiotics and intravenous diuretics are appropriate in patients with pleural effusions due to pneumonia (ie, uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion) or heart failure, respectively. However, these effusions are likely to present with other signs and symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, peripheral edema, fever, cough), which this patient lacks.

Educational objective:

Pleural effusions occur in almost half of patients who undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The majority of these effusions are small, asymptomatic, and benign. When the effusion is small to moderate in size, begins within 1 or 2 days of surgery, and does not cause respiratory symptoms, it can be managed conservatively with observation.

This patient has a classic presentation of arterial occlusion leading to acute limb ischemia (ALI): Pain, Pallor, Paresthesia, Pulselessness, Poikilothermia (cool extremity), and Paralysis (6 Ps). His occlusion may be due to either embolism of a left atrial thrombus in the setting of atrial fibrillation (eg, palpitations, irregular pulse) or thrombosis following atherosclerotic plaque rupture in the setting of peripheral artery disease (PAD) (eg, claudication).

Version

Patients with ALI diagnosed via clinical examination should be immediately given anticoagulation (eg, intravenous heparin infusion). Anticoagulation prevents further arterial thrombus propagation, as well as distal arterial and venous thrombosis (from stasis), while the patient undergoes further diagnostic imaging or awaits surgical intervention.

For some patients, anticoagulation may result in clinical improvement. However, many patients require percutaneous thrombolysis (eg, alteplase) or surgical thrombectomy to restore perfusion to the threatened limb.

For some patients, anticoagulation may result in clinical improvement. However, many patients require percutaneous thrombolysis (eg, alteplase) or surgical thrombectomy to restore perfusion to the threatened limb.

(Choices A and E) The ankle-brachia! index (ABI), the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the ankle compared with that in the arm, can help confirm suspected PAD, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can help identify cardiac sources of emboli (eg, left atrial thrombus due to atrial fibrillation). This patient may eventually benefit from nonurgent ABI evaluation of the right leg, given his history of claudication, and from TTE prior to hospital discharge, given his likely atrial fibrillation. However, these tests should be performed only after his emergent ALI has been treated with intravenous heparin infusion followed by thrombolysis or surgery.

(Choice B) CT angiography of the lower extremities can provide anatomic information about the location of the arterial occlusion and help guide decisions about invasive interventions. However, initiation of systemic anticoagulation (eg, intravenous heparin infusion) should occur first, as soon as the clinical diagnosis of ALI (eg, pulselessness) is made, to prevent further clot propagation while imaging is ongoing.

(Choice D) Surgical bypass grafting is typically used in the setting of chronic PAD to improve distal perfusion past an area of severe or complete atherosclerotic luminal stenosis. In this patient with acute occlusion due to embolus or thrombus, surgical thrombectomy would be more appropriate. Regardless, anticoagulation should be initiated first.

This patient with multiple joint dislocations, easy bruising, poor wound healing, and wide, atrophic scars likely has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a collection of genetic disorders marked by impaired synthesis or processing of connective tissue (eg, collagen, extracellular matrix). Although manifestations vary depending on the genetic mutation, most cases are marked by ~1 of the following:

• Joint hypermobility/laxity, which may result in multiple joint dislocations

• Skin hyperextensibility, which allows skin to stretch ~4 cm

• Tissue fragility, which leads to easy bruising and spontaneous organ rupture

• Poor wound healing, which leads to the formation of wide, atrophic scars ("cigarette paper-like")

(Choice A) Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations to fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, which leads to short stature (<120 cm), long bone shortening, and macrocephaly. Patients with achondroplasia sometimes have joint laxity and dislocations, but atrophic scars are atypical. Furthermore, this patient does not have short stature, making achondroplasia unlikely.

(Choice D) Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations to the fibrillin 1 gene, which results in connective tissue defects. Although patients frequently have joint laxity, most also have excessive long bone growth (leading to tall height) and aortic root disease (eg, dilation, aortic regurgitation, dissection). This patient's height, transthoracic echocardiogram with no aortic root disease, and atrophic scars make EDS more likely.

Version

(Choice E) Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder of type I collagen, which leads to bone fractures with minimal trauma. Repeated joint dislocation would be atypical.

Educational objective:

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a collection of genetic connective tissue disorders. It is usually characterized by joint hypermobility/laxity, multiple joint dislocations, tissue fragility, poor wound healing, and cigarette, paper-like scarring.

Version

This patient's acute onset of severe flank pain, syncope, and hemodynamic instability is concerning for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA typically occurs in patients age >60 and is more common in smokers, men, and those with a history of atherosclerosis or connective tissue disease. Patients typically have few symptoms until the AAA markedly expands or ruptures, precipitating abdominal or flank pain. Less common presentations include distal ischemia, due to embolization of the thrombus or of atherosclerotic debris from the aneurysm; and high-output heart failure, resulting from erosion of the AAA into the vena cava (ie, aortocaval fistula).

AAA rupture usually occurs posteriorly into the retroperitoneum, which can delay the onset of hemodynamic instability (eg, 1 h of symptoms in this patient); however, rupture may occur

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture (63%,)

A.

AAA rupture usually occurs posteriorly into the retroperitoneum, which can delay the onset of hemodynamic instability (eg, 1 h of symptoms in this patient); however, rupture may occur anteriorly with direct leakage into the peritoneum and rapid onset of hemodynamic instability and shock. Physical examination may reveal a pulsatile abdominal mass at the umbilicus as well as flank or umbilical hematomas. However, findings are sometimes subtle or nonspecific. Delayed or missed diagnosis is common because ruptured AAA often mimics other abdominal pathologies (eg, renal colic, acute pancreatitis) and approximately 75% of presenting patients have no known history of AAA.

(Choice B) Acute pyelonephritis commonly presents with flank pain, and hemodynamic instability may occur due to sepsis; however, this patient's lack of fever or dysuria makes this diagnosis less likely.

E. Perforation of diverticula (5%)

(Choice C) Acute renal infarction presents with abdominal or flank pain. However, it is accompanied by hypertension (rather than hypotension) due to increased renin secretion; fever is also common.

(Choice D) Nephrolithiasis with obstruction would not account for this patient's hemodynamic instability and reduced peripheral pulses. Of note, AAA complicated by an aortocaval fistula can cause venous congestion of the bladder, sometimes leading to hematuria that is misdiagnosed as nephrolithiasis.

Explanation

A 55-year-old man comes to the office due to chronic pain in his buttock, hip, and thigh muscles. The aching pain is present in both legs and usually is associated with walking. He has multiple medical problems and takes several medications. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 36. 7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 150/88 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. Examination shows decreased femoral, popliteal, and dorsalis pedis pulses in both legs. Which of the following additional complaints is most likely in this patient?

This patient has arterial occlusion at the bifurcation of the aorta into the common iliac arteries (aortoiliac occlusion), with findings suggestive of Leriche syndrome, which is characterized by the triad of:

• Bilateral hip, thigh, and buttock claudication

• Absent or diminished femoral pulses: from the groin distally, often with symmetric atrophy of the bilateral lower extremities due to chronic ischemia

A. Snoring (1%)

B. Headache (2%)

C. Anorexia (0%)

D. Ankle swelling (7%)

E. Impotence (87%)

F. Neck pain (0%)

• Impotence: almost always present in men with this condition; in the absence of impotence, an alternate diagnosis should be sought

Men with a predisposition for atherosclerosis, such as smokers, are at the greatest risk of this condition. Because impotence is not uncommon in this age group and hip and thigh pain with walking may also be attributed to osteoarthritis, the diagnosis of aortoiliac occlusion can be missed if a thorough vascular examination is not performed.

(Choice B) Temporal arteritis is associated with new-onset headache, temporal tenderness and pulselessness, older age, and an increased ESR. Jaw claudication and amaurosis fugax may also occur.

(Choice C) Anorexia may be a sign of an underlying malignancy, mesenteric ischemia, or bowel disorder.

Version

(Choice D) Ankle swelling may result from venous insufficiency, renal insufficiency, right heart failure, or hepatic disease; however, it is not a common finding in arterial occlusive disease.

(Choice F) Neck pain is typically associated with cervical pathology rather than aortoiliac occlusion.

Educational objective:

Aortoiliac occlusion (Leriche syndrome) is characterized by the triad of bilateral hip, thigh, and buttock claudication; impotence; and absent or diminished femoral pulses (often with symmetric atrophy of the bilateral lower extremities due to chronic ischemia).

This patient with a fall >3 m [10 ft] followed by rapid deceleration (landing on pavement) is at risk for blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) because the abrupt change in velocity exerts a combination of stretching, shearing, and torsional forces capable of rupturing the aorta. Patient presentation depends on the degree of aortic rupture; those with an incomplete rupture (as with this patient) may be normotensive to hypertensive (due to sympathetic response) and may initially appear stable even though they have a life-threatening injury.

All patients with blunt chest trauma require a chest x-ray after primary trauma survey. Although patients with BTAI may have a normal chest x-ray, findings concerning for BTAI include:

• Widened mediastinum or abnormal aortic contour (eg, enlarged aortic knob) from either an intimal tear (creating a secondary, false lumen similar to aortic dissection) or

A. Blunt aortic injury (81 %)

either an intimal tear (creating a secondary, false lumen similar to aortic dissection) or incomplete rupture of the intima and media (where the adventitia expands under highflow pressure) • Left-sided effusion (ie, hemothorax) from aortic bleeding into the thorax

Diagnosis can be confirmed via CT angiography for hemodynamically stable patients or transesophageal echocardiography (likely in the operating room) for unstable, hypotensive patients.

(Choice B) Diaphragmatic rupture typically presents with loss of diaphragmatic contour and/or presence of abdominal organs (eg, stomach, bowel) within the thoracic cavity, which may cause a mass-effect mediastinal shift (but not widening).

(Choice C) Left ventricular aneurysm appears as a prominence or bulge along the left heart border, not as a widened mediastinum. It is typically seen as a complication of transmural myocardial infarction rather than trauma.

(Choice D) Myocardial contusion has no specific chest x-ray findings, although sternal fracture should raise suspicion. It is typically diagnosed by ECG (showing arrhythmia or new bundle branch block) or echocardiography (showing wall motion abnormality or decreased contractility).

(Choice E) Pulmonary contusion causes parenchymal hemorrhage and edema that manifests as irregular, nonlobular opacities.

(Choice F) Tracheobronchial disruption may cause mediastinal widening due to rapid efflux of air from the injured tracheobronchial tree; however, air would be visualized as pneumomediastinum. In addition, pneumothorax and/or subcutaneous emphysema would likely be present.

A 50-year-old man comes to the physician for a preventive visit. He has no chest pain or shortness of breath but does complain of occasional left posterior calf pain. The pain occurs most often with walking in the course of his job as a postal carrier, but he occasionally has leg cramps at rest. His other medical problems include diet-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension, but he does not take any medication regularly. The patient was hospitalized for chest pain 2 years ago. Cardiac stress test at that time was negative and he has had no recurrence. The patient has a 30-pack-year smoking history but does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. His father died suddenly at age 60, and his mother had a stroke in her ?Os. His blood pressure is 138/92 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and body mass index is 28 kg/m . 2 Heart and lung examinations show no abnormalities. Popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses are palpable bilaterally. An electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm. His hemoglobin A 1c level is 7.2%. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

This patient has multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis (diabetes, hypertension, and smoking) and symptoms consistent with intermittent claudication. The next step in management should be to obtain physiologic testing with ankle-brachia! index (ABI) to confirm the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) as a cause of his symptoms. ABI is an inexpensive and noninvasive vascular test used to confirm the diagnosis of PAD in such patients. It is defined as the ratio of resting systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the systolic brachia! blood pressure. An ABI of <0.90 is considered diagnostic of occlusive PAD with a 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity in symptomatic patients.

A 56-year-old hospitalized man is evaluated for recurrent chest pain. The patient was admitted 3 days ago due to a 1-day history of precordial chest pain. Evaluation revealed acute myocardial infarction and a drug-eluting stent was placed in the left anterior descending artery. His symptoms had resolved after the procedure but today the patient experienced sharp chest pain radiating to his left shoulder. He could only get comfortable sitting up but has had no orthopnea or palpitation. Current medications include aspirin, prasugrel, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 112/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 101/min and regular. Physical examination shows no heart murmurs and the lungs are clear bilaterally.

This patient most likely has peri-infarction pericarditis (PIP). In contrast with post-cardiac injury (Dressler) syndrome, an immune-mediated pericarditis that typically occurs several weeks following myocardial injury, PIP results from local inflammation and typically occurs <4 days following myocardial infarction (Ml). Patients with delayed coronary reperfusion following ST-segment elevation Ml (eg, >3 hr from symptom onset) are at increased risk of developing PIP, as in this patient who initially presented with a 1-day history of chest pain.

Like other types of pericarditis, PIP typically presents with pleuritic chest pain that improves with sitting upright and often radiates to the left shoulder or posteriorly to the bilateral scapulae. ECG commonly shows widespread ST-segment elevation and/or PR-segment depression. All patients suspected of having PIP should undergo echocardiography, which allows for characterization of any associated pericardial effusion and helps rule out other

Treatment is usually supportive. Acetaminophen may be taken for pain control, but antiinflammatory agents (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are typically avoided for at least 7 days due to a possible increased risk of free wall rupture.

(Choices A and E) Coronary angiography is indicated for suspected recurrent MI due to plaque rupture or stent thrombosis. However, such an event is unlikely to present as sharp, position-dependent chest pain and would not cause widespread PR-segment depression on ECG. Serum troponin level is often of limited use in evaluating recurrent post-Ml chest pain as the level can remain elevated for up to 2 weeks following the initial Ml.

compartment syndrome, a limb-threatening condition caused by increased pressure within an enclosed fascial space that limits perfusion of muscle and nerve tissues. It is most common following traumatic injuries (eg, long bone fracture) or prolonged compression of an extremity, but it may also occur following reperfusion of an acutely ischemic limb (ie, ischemiareperfusion injury) due to interstitial edema and possibly intracellular swelling.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring compartment pressures (eg, needle manometry). A delta pressure (diastolic blood pressure - compartment pressure) S30 mm Hg indicates inadequate tissue perfusion and is strongly suggestive of compartment syndrome; it is typically more useful than an absolute compartment pressure because diastolic pressure can vary significantly (eg, systemic hypotension). Definitive management includes emergency fasciotomy.

(Choice B) Deep tissue infection (eg, necrotizing fasciitis, clostridial gas gangrene) is commonly due to group A Streptococcus or mixed anaerobic infection. Like compartment syndrome, these syndromes can present with severe pain out of proportion to clinical signs, but symptoms generally evolve over several hours to days and are usually associated with skin necrosis, bullae, crepitus, and significant systemic toxicity (eg, high fever, hypotension).

(Choice C) Recurrent embolism may produce features similar to compartment syndrome (eg, severe pain, paresthesia) but would typically be associated with absent pulses, pallor of the affected limb, and lack of local swelling.

(Choice D) Vasoocclusive crisis is a complication of sickle cell disease characterized by severe pain and tissue ischemia. Episodes are typically precipitated by dehydration, cold temperatures, exertion, or hypoxemia, and typically manifest in early childhood with recurrent crises. Examination findings may include erythema and warmth, but swelling is unusual and clinical features are often bilateral and symmetric.

Version

(Choice E) Deep vein thrombosis may cause calf pain and swelling, but severe pain and sensory or motor deficits are more consistent with compartment syndrome.

Educational objective:

Compartment syndrome can occur following reperfusion of an acutely ischemic limb. Features include tense swelling; paresthesia; severe pain that is worsened with passive range of motion; and sensory and motor deficits. The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring compartment pressures. Definitive management includes emergency fasciotomy.

A 72-year-old man comes to the office due to fatigue and lower extremity swelling for the last several weeks. He also has a feeling of pulsation in his neck when he lies down. He has no chest pain. The patient takes lisinopril and amlodipine for hypertension. He underwent permanent pacemaker implantation for sick sinus syndrome 6 months ago. He is a lifetime nonsmoker. The patient has no family history of cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure is 112/70 mm Hg and pulse is 79/min and regular. The jugular veins are distended with the patient in the sitting position. A 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard over the left lower sternal border. The lungs are clear on auscultation. The liver is enlarged and mildly tender on palpation. Bilateral 3+ edema is present in the lower extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

This patient likely has severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) due to an adverse effect of his permanent pacemaker. The right ventricular lead of a transvenous implantable pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator passes through the superior vena cava into the right atrium and then through the tricuspid valve to terminate in the endocardium of the right ventricle. Damage to the tricuspid valve leaflets or inadequate leaflet coaptation can occur, leading to severe TR in 10%-20°/oof patients.

Chronic, severe TR typically presents with right-sided heart failure. Patients can have distended jugular veins, pulsatile and tender hepatomegaly, abdominal distension with ascites, and lower extremity edema. Cardiac examination typically reveals right ventricular heave and a holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border; the murmur intensifies with maneuvers that increase right ventricular preload (eg, deep inspiration, leg raise). The diagnosis of TR is confirmed by echocardiogram.

Hemodynamic compromise within the first few days following myocardial infarction (Ml) should raise suspicion for a mechanical complication of Ml, as the healing myocardium is most prone to rupture during this time. The 3 major mechanical complications of Ml include:

• left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture

• interventricular septum rupture

• mitral regurgitation (MR) due to papillary muscle rupture

Delayed (or absent) reperfusion increases the risk of these complications.

This patient's presentation is most consistent with acute MR due to papillary muscle rupture, which typically occurs acutely or within 3-5 days of Ml. The posteromedial papillary muscle is most commonly affected due to single-vessel blood supply from the right coronary artery (in contrast, the anterolateral papillary muscle receives dual blood supply from the left circumflex and left anterior descending [LAD] arteries).

A 64-year-old man with a long history of uncontrolled hypertension is brought to the emergency department due to chest pain for the last 8 hours. ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Percutaneous coronary intervention, performed via right femoral artery access, demonstrates complete occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Stenting is performed, and appropriate medical therapy is initiated. Six days later, the patient develops sudden onset of severe left leg pain. On examination, the left lower leg is cold and mottled in appearance, without swelling. The femoral pulses are palpable and symmetric; the pedal pulses are present on the right and absent on the left. Vascular surgery is consulted. Which of the following should also be considered in this patient?

A. D-dimer assay (6%)

B. Echocardiography (37%)

Explanation

This patient with sudden onset of severe left leg pain and signs of arterial occlusion (eg, cold, mottled leg lacking pedal pulses) has acute limb ischemia (ALI). Although ALI is often due to thrombosis (eg, plaque), it can also be caused by embolism (eg, thrombus). Given this patient's recent anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), his ALI is most likely due to embolization of a left ventricular (LV) mural thrombus.

0

Q Q

C. Lower extremity venous Doppler study (38%)

D. Ultrasound of the right groin (10%)

E. Ventilation-perfusion scan (7%)

Patients with a large anterior STEMI from occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery are at highest risk for LV aneurysm formation, especially when reperfusion therapy is unfeasible or delayed (eg, treatment initiated after 8 hr of ischemia in this patient). When an LV aneurysm forms, the infarcted muscle fails to contract (or even balloons outward) during systole and is associated with a low ejection fraction and stasis of adjacent blood. This may lead to formation of an LV thrombus that can embolize, causing stroke or ALI, as in this patient.

In addition to emergency treatment of ALI (eg, heparin infusion, vascular surgery consultation), this patient should undergo transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with contrast to assess for an LV aneurysm and/or residual thrombus. The presence of either finding may impact the duration of anticoagulation.

However, lower extremity venous thrombosis, which can be detected with venous Doppler study, typically causes swellling and/or warmth.

(Choice D) Femoral arterial cannulation during percutaneous coronary intervention can be complicated by acute thrombosis or pseudoaneurysm (with subsequent thrombosis), which may be detected on groin ultrasound. However, the resulting ALI would affect the ipsilateral lower leg (ie, right leg in this patient), and the femoral pulse would be abnormal.

This patient with a history of breast cancer has developed a large, malignant pericardial effusion (MPE) with associated dyspnea, chest discomfort, and tachycardia. Malignancy is a common cause of pericardia! effusion, which may be the initial clinical manifestation of recurrence, as in this patient. Common tumor types associated with MPE include breast cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma.

Version

Subacute accumulation of pericardia! fluid (eg, over weeks) gives the pericardium time to progressively stretch; therefore, a large fluid volume (eg, 700 ml) may accumulate. Patients often experience only nonspecific symptoms (eg, dyspnea, chest discomfort) until enough fluid (typically 1-2 l) accumulates to increase intrapericardial pressure and compromise cardiac function (ie, cardiac tamponade).

• Acute drainage: Pericardiocentesis is performed to relieve patient symptoms, treat early signs of cardiac compromise (eg, tachycardia), and/or obtain fluid for cytologic evaluation.

• Prevention of reaccumulation: A means for prolonged pericardia! drainage is recommended because fluid reaccumulates frequently (eg, up to 60% of cases). This is typically achieved either through the creation of a pericardial window (surgical removal of part of the pericardium to allow pericardi.al fluid to drain into the pleural or peritoneal cavity) or through prolonged pericardial catheter drainage.

This patient has a diastolic murmur (classically graded on a scale of 1 to 4, unlike systolic murmurs) consistent with valvular aortic regurgitation. (In contrast to the murmur of aortic regurgitation due to root dilation, best heard at the traditional aortic auscultation area in the right sternal border, the murmur of valvular aortic regurgitation is best heard at the left sternal border.) Given his history of a mechanical prosthetic aortic valve, this presentation should raise suspicion for prosthetic valve dysfunction (PVD), which most commonly occurs in the following forms:

Version

• Paravalvular leak (regurgitation around the valve): more commonly occurs with mechanical (rather than bioprosthetic) valves and results from dehiscence of the valve from the aortic or mitral annulus, often due to annular degeneration or underlying infective endocarditis.

• Transvalvular regurgitation (regurgitation through the valve): more commonly affects bioprosthetic (rather than mechanical) valves and can result from cusp degeneration or occasionally valvular thrombus that impairs valve closure. Patients are often initially asymptomatic but can develop severe heart failure; those with significant regurgitation generally have a poor prognosis.

Complete blood count and peripheral blood smear (revealing schistocytes) are used for diagnosis. However, significant anemia is unlikely in this asymptomatic patient; in addition, mild hemolysis may be seen normally with a prosthetic valve, also making a peripheral smear less helpful.

(Choice D) Hypercoagulability studies may be appropriate if valvular thrombus is identified. However, this patient's therapeutic INR (eg, INR 2-3 for mechanical aortic valve) and adherence to warfarin therapy make thrombus less likely. In addition, echocardiography is needed first to evaluate PVD.

Version

(Choice E) Routine clinical follow-up is not appropriate because this patient's murmur suggests possible serious PVD that should be evaluated with echocardiography.

Educational objective:

A regurgitant murmur over a prosthetic valve suggests prosthetic valve dysfunction (PVD) in the form of a paravalvular leak or transvalvular regurgitation. PVD can lead to serious complications (eg, heart failure) and should be promptly evaluated with echocardiography.

A 60-year-old man comes to the office due to a week of fevers and fatigue. The patient has no cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. Medical history is significant for a mechanical aortic valve and hypertension. The patient takes warfarin and amlodipine. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 39.4 C (102.9 F), blood pressure is 136/60 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 18/min. The lungs are clear to auscultation. An early diastolic murmur is noted at the cardiac base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Leukocyte count is 17,000/mm 3 with 80% neutrophils; INR is 3.0. Chest x-ray reveals no infiltrates and ECG is normal. Broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics are administered, and blood cultures from admission grow methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to vancomycin at 48 hours. Transthoracic echocardiography shows normal transaortic velocities and no vegetations. What is the best next step in management?

Explanation

This patient with a mechanical aortic valve has fever, leukocytosis, Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and a diastolic murmur at the base consistent with aortic regurgitation. This presentation raises strong suspicion for aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). Although patients with suspected PVE often undergo transthoracic echocardiography {TTE}, this study detects PVE in only ~55% of cases; therefore, false-negative results (eg, normalappearing valve and valvular function) are common, particularly early in the illness.

The diagnostic test of choice for patients with suspected PVE is transesophageal echocardiography {TEE); this test has a sensitivity of ~85% for aortic PVE and is much better than TTE at visualizing vegetations and complications of infection (eg, fistula, leaflet rupture, abscess, pseudoaneurysm, paraprosthetic leak). Therefore, TEE is required in most cases, particularly if suspicion is high and TTE is unrevealing (as in this patient).

C. Obtain a CT scan of the abdomen (2%)

D. Obtain a CT scan of the chest (4°/o)

Although rates of PVE are greatest in the first months following implantation of the prosthesis (because it is not yet covered in endothelium), all patients with prosthetic valves have an elevated risk of infective endocarditis compared to those with native valves. This is thought to be due to the formation of microthrombi on the abnormal valve surface, which is then seeded during periods of transient bacteremia.

A 60-year-old man comes to the office due to a week of fevers and fatigue. The patient has no cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. Medical history is significant for a mechanical aortic valve and hypertension. The patient takes warfarin and amlodipine. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 39.4 C (102.9 F), blood pressure is 136/60 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 18/min. The lungs are clear to auscultation. An early diastolic murmur is noted at the cardiac base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Leukocyte count is 17,000/mm 3 with 80% neutrophils; INR is 3.0. Chest x-ray reveals no infiltrates and ECG is normal. Broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics are administered, and blood cultures from admission grow methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to vancomycin at 48 hours. Transthoracic echocardiography shows normal transaortic velocities and no vegetations. What is the best next step in management?

Although rates of PVE are greatest in the first months following implantation of the prosthesis (because it is not yet covered in endothelium), all patients with prosthetic valves have an elevated risk of infective endocarditis compared to those with native valves. This is thought to be due to the formation of microthrombi on the abnormal valve surface, which is then seeded during periods of transient bacteremia.

(Choice A) Patients on warfarin with life-threatening bleeding require intravenous vitamin K to reverse anticoagulation. Patients with no bleeding and very high INRs (eg, >10) require oral vitamin Kand holding of warfarin. Individuals with no bleeding and INRs <10 (as in this case) do not generally require intervention other than holding warfarin.

Patients with prosthetic valves are at high risk for prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). Because transthoracic echocardiography has a sensitivity of only ~55%, patients generally require transesophageal echocardiography {TEE), which has a sensitivity of ~85% and is much better at identifying vegetations and complications of infection (eg, abscess, ruptured leaflet, fistula).

This patient's abrupt-onset chest and neck pain in the setting of long-standing hypertension is concerning for acute aortic dissection. A widened mediastinum on chest x-ray, which can be caused by blood filling the aortic wall to create a wide false lumen, further suggests the diagnosis. Syncope occurs in approximately 10% of cases and may result from a pain-induced vasovagal response or an abrupt drop in brain perfusion due to a mechanical disruption of blood flow. Sudden and transient increases in blood pressure-as can occur with cocaine use, power lifting, or intense coughing (eg, in the setting of an upper respiratory illness)-may encourage intimal tearing and initiation of aortic dissection.

Diagnostic confirmation of suspected acute aortic dissection should be promptly sought; CT angiography of the aorta (CT aortography) is usually the preferred test. Transesophageal echocardiography can be performed rapidly in the operating room and is often preferred in patients with hemodynamic instability. Type A (ascending) aortic dissection is a surgical emergency with acute mortality rates of 1%-2°/oper hour after symptom onset.

A 56-year-old man comes to the office due to exertional dyspnea for the past month. He has great difficulty walking half a block without experiencing shortness of breath. He also has palpitations, dry cough, and lower extremity swelling. He has no chest pain, lightheadedness, or syncope. The patient was hospitalized 4 months ago for myocardial infarction after having 2 days of chest pain. He also has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, intermittent asthma, and gout. He is a current smoker with a 35-pack-year history. His father suffered a myocardial infarction at age 50 and died of heart disease at age 55. Blood pressure is 144/86 mm Hg, pulse is 72/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. BMI is 32 kg/m . 2 He does not appear to be in acute distress. Physical examination shows distended jugular veins while sitting up. Bibasilar crackles are heard on lung auscultation.

This patient has developed heart failure likely due to a left ventricular aneurysm. Ventricular aneurysm is a late complication of myocardial infarction (Ml) that can occur up to several months following a transmural (ST elevation) Ml; a delay in coronary reperfusion increases the risk. The healing process following MI results in replacement of necrosed myocardium with fibrous scar tissue, which in the case of a large Ml can result in convexity of a large portion of the left ventricular wall (most commonly in the perfusion field of the left anterior descending artery). The aneurysm is dyskinetic with the remaining healthy ventricular wall, resulting in impaired ejection fraction.

Although heart failure (eg, jugular venous distension, pulmonary crackles) is the most common presentation, angina may also occur due to increased oxygen demand caused by elevated wall stress in the setting of an enlarged left ventricle. Ventricular arrhythmia or systemic embolization (due to mural thrombus inside the aneurysm) is possible as well. Classical ECG findings include persistent ST-segment elevation and deep Q waves in the leads corresponding to the previous Ml, and diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiogram showing a thinned and dyskinetic myocardial wall.

A 38-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to a day of progressive shortness of breath. Over the past week, he has also had fever and malaise. The patient uses intravenous heroin daily. Temperature is 39.6 C (103.3 F), blood pressure is 100/56 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min and regular, and respirations are 20/min. Oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. The patient is in moderate respiratory distress. Bibasilar crackles are heard on lung auscultation. Cardiac examination reveals a 3/6 holosystolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla. There is 1+ bilateral pedal edema. Laboratory evaluation shows a hematocrit of 33°/oand a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm 3 with a left shift. ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Chest x-ray reveals pulmonary edema and no cardiomegaly. Echocardiography demonstrates a 1-cm vegetation on the mitral valve and severe mitral regurgitation.

This patient who uses intravenous heroin has subacute nonspecific symptoms, fever, leukocytosis, and a mitral valve vegetation, indicating infective endocarditis (IE). His acute shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, and bilateral lower extremity edema suggests that he is in heart failure, likely due to severe mitral regurgitation from infectious destruction of the valve. Heart failure is the most common cause of death in patients with IE and most commonly occurs with infection of the aortic or mitral valves. Although patients with intravenous drug use are most likely to develop right-sided IE, isolated or concurrent infection of the left-sided heart valves frequently occurs.

• Localized extension of infection (eg, abscess, fistula, heart block)

• Difficult-to-treat pathogens (eg, fungi, multidrug-resistant organisms)

• Very high risk of embolism (eg, large valvular vegetation [>1 cm]) or persistent septic embolization despite appropriate antibiotic therapy

(Choice A) Septic embolism is common in patients with IE. However, anticoagulation does not diminish the risk of septic embolization and may increase the risk of bleeding complications; therefore, it is not recommended.

A. Intravenous heparin infusion (25%)

B. Intravenous metoprolol (4%)

C. No additional intervention (15%)

D. Radionucleotide bone scan (0%)

E. Surgical consultation (53%)

(Choice B) Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should be initiated on beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) to reduce mortality and hospitalization rates. However, beta blockers should not be started until acute volume overload has resolved. This patient is in acute heart failure with symptomatic volume overload; a beta blocker should not be initiated at this time.

(Choice D) Radionucleotide bone scan is used to evaluate for a focus of infection in bone (eg, osteomyelitis). This patient has a clear source for his symptoms (mitral valve vegetation in the setting of injection drug use) and no localized bone complaints; a radionucleotide bone scan would not be indicated at this time.

A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter after she found him confused and febrile at home. Since the patient's wife died 6 months ago, he has insisted on continuing to live independently; however, he has taken worse care of his health, including refusing doctor's visits. Medical history includes type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral artery disease. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F). Blood pressure is 98/54 mm Hg and pulse is 104/min. The patient is lethargic but opens his eyes when his name is called. He is not oriented to place, time, or situation. Both lower extremities are without palpable dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, or popliteal pulses. The left foot is shown in the image below. In addition to obtaining blood cultures and administering antibiotics, which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

This patient with peripheral artery disease (PAD) leading to gangrene of his distal left foot now has signs of systemic infection (eg, fever, confusion, lethargy). In this setting of infected gangrene, amputation of the foot should be performed promptly to remove the infectious source and prevent overwhelming sepsis.

Despite its morbidity, lower extremity amputation may be necessary and even lifesaving to remove ischemic, infected, and/or necrotic tissue. Indications for lower extremity amputation include:

• Critical limb ischemia without the ability, either anatomically or due to comorbidity contraindications, to perform revascularization

• Unsalvageable lower extremity soft tissue (eg, trauma, gangrene, frostbite)

• Life-threatening infection (eg, infected gangrene, necrotizing soft-tissue infection)

In this patient, urgent amputation without soft-tissue closure (ie, guillotine amputation) will likely be performed; this removes the obvious necrotic tissue and encourages further drainage to avoid trapping any ascending infection. Following continued antibiotics and dressing changes, if the patient clinically improves and the wound appears clean and viable, secondary stump soft-tissue closure can occur.

(Choice B) Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy can augment oxygen delivery to ischemic tissues and improve wound healing. Although HBO may eventually be indicated (eg, delayed healing due to PAD), this patient's gangrenous tissue causing systemic infection demands that amputation be performed first.

(Choice C) Some patients with advanced PAD may benefit from a revascularization procedure to improve distal lower extremity perfusion, if appropriate distal vessel targets are available. However, in this patient with infected gangrene, revascularization would not reverse established tissue necrosis and may require foreign body (eg, synthetic graft) placement, which would further increase infection risk (eg, infected graft). Amputation must be performed to prevent overwhelming sepsis.

Patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) (eg, mitral regurgitation) undergoing noncardiac surgery have an increased risk for cardiac complications (eg, heart failure, death). Therefore, preoperative evaluation of VHD must determine whether the benefits of postponing surgery for valve intervention (ie, repair or replacement) outweigh the risks of proceeding with surgery

A 67-year-old woman is evaluated in the hospital prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute calculous cholecystitis. She has had no dyspnea, chest pain, light-headedness, or leg swelling. The patient does not exercise, but she routinely climbs the stairs to her second-floor bedroom without difficulty. Medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia. Blood pressure is 142/86 mm Hg and pulse is 76/min and regular. Cardiac examination demonstrates a hyperdynamic apical impulse and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla.

Transthoracic echocardiography reveals moderate mitral regurgitation and normal left ventricular size with an ejection fraction of 65%; there is no significant pulmonary artery hypertension. Which of the following is the most appropriate management prior to surgery?

Preoperative valve intervention depends primarily on the severity of VHD (eg, mild vs moderate/severe), presence of symptoms, and risk of noncardiac surgery (eg, low vs intermediate/high). Patients with mild VHD can typically proceed to noncardiac surgery without further cardiac workup (regardless of symptoms). Conversely, symptomatic patients with moderate/severe VHD benefit from preoperative valve intervention when possible.

For asymptomatic patients with moderate/severe VHD, stratification depends on surgical risk and any cardiopulmonary effects due to the VHD:

• Asymptomatic patients with moderate/severe VHD undergoing low-risk procedures (eg, cataract) can proceed without further workup.

• In asymptomatic patients with moderate/severe VHD undergoing intermediate-risk surgery (eg, intraabdominal procedure without bowel resection) or high-risk surgery (eg, major transplant surgery), the benefit of preoperative valve intervention depends on whether the VHD is causing significant cardiopulmonary effects; this is generally assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE} (eg, decreased ejection fraction, significant pulmonary hypertension). Those with no significant cardiopulmonary effects can typically undergo surgery without further intervention.

This patient scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (intermediate-risk) has asymptomatic moderate mitral regurgitation with no significant cardiopulmonary effects (normal ejection fraction, no significant pulmonary hypertension). Therefore, she can undergo noncardiac surgery without further cardiac testing.

This patient is most likely in cardiogenic shock due to an acute myocardial infarction (Ml). Perioperative Ml is common in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery; intraoperative hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion increases the risk (likely due to reduced oxygen delivery to the myocardium). Patients with perioperative Ml often lack chest pain, possibly due to receipt of postoperative pain control (eg, morphine).

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's current condition?

Significant infarction of the left ventricle leads to impaired contractility and a decrease in left ventricular stroke volume. Cardiac index (Cl), which is a measure of cardiac output (stroke volume x heart rate) adjusted per body surface area, is low as tachycardia cannot make up for the decrease in stroke volume. The increased pressure in the left ventricle is transmitted back to the left atrium and the lungs; therefore, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), which estimates left atrial pressure, is elevated. Patients experience dyspnea and hypoxemia due to pulmonary edema, and lung examination reveals bilateral crackles. Decreased cardiac output leads to hypotension, for which the body attempts to compensate by peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance. Low tissue perfusion signals the tissues to extract more oxygen from the blood, which decreases mixed venous oxygen saturation.

B. Adrenal crisis (1°/o)

C. Myocardial infarction (48%)

D. Pulmonary embolism (13%)

(Choice F) Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) refers to the development of fever, hypotension, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema within 6 hours of blood product administration. Because left ventricular function is typically normal, PAC reveals normal or high Cl and normal or low PCWP.

Educational objective:

Patients with perioperative myocardial infarction may lack chest pain and can develop cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Pulmonary artery catheterization reveals a low cardiac index and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

A 68-year-old man is recovering in the intensive care unit after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Two weeks ago, he was seen in the office for progressive exertional angina and shortness of breath. The patient underwent coronary angiography, which indicated severe extensive coronary artery disease. After discussion about the risks and benefits, he agreed to proceed with open heart surgery. The patient has a family history of coronary artery disease but no sudden cardiac death, heart failure, or bleeding. On postoperative day 1, the nurses report that the patient is confused and has had reduced urine output. Temperature is 35.6 C (96 F), blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, pulse is 118/min and regular, and respirations are 22/min. There is no drainage from his sternal wound, and there has been no drainage in the chest tube over the last 4 hours. The lung fields are clear. No heart murmurs are appreciated. The abdomen is soft. His extremities are cool. ECG shows sinus tachycardia and nonspecific T-wave changes. Pulmonary artery catheter readings are as follows: Right atrium 20 mm Hg (normal: 2-8 mm Hg), right ventricle 35/20 mm Hg (normal: 15-30 mm Hg / 2-8 mm Hg), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 20 mm Hg (normal: 6-12 mm Hg).

This patient most likely has postoperative cardiac tamponade, a relatively rare but important early complication of coronary artery bypass grafting. Rapid accumulation of blood in the limited pericardia! space leads to increased diastolic pressure in the chambers of the heart and severe impairment in venous return. Patients typically have evidence of shock with hypoperfusion (eg, hypotension, reduced urine output, cool extremities); the classic finding is the triad of hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, and distant heart sounds (Beck triad). Characteristically, there is elevation and equalization of intracardiac diastolic pressures (right atrial, right ventricular, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggestive of left atrial pressure), as shown on this patient's pulmonary artery catheterization.

Cardiac tamponade can rapidly lead to cardiac arrest if left untreated. Urgent

There is no drainage from his sternal wound, and there has been no drainage in the chest tube over the last 4 hours. The lung fields are clear. No heart murmurs are appreciated. The abdomen is soft. His extremities are cool. ECG shows sinus tachycardia and nonspecific T-wave changes. Pulmonary artery catheter readings are as follows: Right atrium 20 mm Hg (normal: 2-8 mm Hg), right ventricle 35/20 mm Hg (normal: 15-30 mm Hg / 2-8 mm Hg), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 20 mm Hg (normal: 6-12 mm Hg). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

Cardiac tamponade can rapidly lead to cardiac arrest if left untreated. Urgent echocardiography confirms the diagnosis and can identify moderate or large pericardia! effusion, right atrial diastolic collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse (highly specific for tamponade ), and bowing of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle during inspiration. Immediate percutaneous or surgical (pericardia! window) drainage of pericardia! fluid relieves elevated intrapericardial pressures and leads to rapid improvement in symptoms and hemodynamic status.

(Choice A) Blood cultures followed by empiric antibiotics are appropriate in patients with suspected septic shock; however, intracardiac pressures are typically low or normal (rather than elevated) due to the loss of intravascular volume that occurs in sepsis.

(Choices B and E) Acute myocardial infarction due to failure of a bypass graft can lead to a similar presentation with cardiogenic shock and may necessitate coronary angiography for diagnosis or dobutamine infusion for inotropic left ventricular support. However, acute heart failure due to myocardial infarction does not typically cause equalization of intracardiac diastolic pressures and also is less likely in the absence of significant ECG changes.

This patient meets modified Duke criteria for infective endocarditis (ie, positive blood culture likely representing Staphylococcus aureus, echocardiographic valvular vegetation). He now has acute-onset dyspnea and pulmonary edema and a holosystolic murmur concerning for acute mitral regurgitation (MR), which can develop as a complication of endocarditis (eg, chordae tendineae rupture).

2023

Version

In acute MR, there is sudden-onset large-volume backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium. Because of the large volume (and rapid equilibration of left ventricular [LV] and left atrial pressures), the associated murmur is often low-grade (eg, 2/6) or absent, unlike in chronic MR. The clinical features primarily reflect the heart chambers' lack of time to adapt to the hemodynamic changes.

• The left atrium has inadequate time to stretch to accommodate the increased blood volume and remains normal in size. The consequent increase in left atrial pressure is transmitted backward to the pulmonary circulation, resulting in pulmonary edema (eg, bibasilar crackles).

• The left atrium has inadequate time to stretch to accommodate the increased blood volume and remains normal in size. The consequent increase in left atrial pressure is transmitted backward to the pulmonary circulation, resulting in pulmonary edema (eg, bibasilar crackles).

• The left ventricle receives increased blood volume from the left atrium with each diastole (representing the additional regurgitant volume from the previous systole); this results in increased LV end-diastolic pressure.

• The ejected blood can flow either forward through the aortic valve or backward through the relatively low-resistance pathway to the left atrium (ie, total resistance [LV afterload] is reduced). Although absolute volume of forward blood flow (cardiac output) is decreased, total stroke volume (forward and backward) is increased, resulting in a normal or hyperdynamic LV ejection fraction (>70% ).

In contrast to acute MR, the slower development of chronic MR allows time for compensatory atrial stretch to accommodate the regurgitant blood volume at a lower filling pressure, preventing pulmonary edema. In addition, the volume-overloaded left ventricle undergoes eccentric hypertrophy to compensate and temporarily maintain cardiac output (Choice A). However, overwhelming wall stress eventually leads to LV contractile dysfunction and decompensated heart failure (Choice C).

Acute mitral regurgitation results in sudden-onset large-volume backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium. Neither chamber has time for compensatory dilation, leading to a rapid increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left atrial pressure, resulting in pulmonary edema. Although forward blood flow is reduced, left ventricular ejection fraction is normal or hyperdynamic due to a large amount of stroke volume flowing backward into the left atrium through the low-resistance regurgitant pathway.

some substances (eg, iodinated contrast, opioids) may stimulate direct mast cell activation (nonimmunologic process), leading to an anaphylaxis-like response that can be clinically indistinguishable from lgE-mediated anaphylaxis.

The primary disturbance in anaphylactic shock is profound peripheral vasodilation (ie, distributive shock, as also seen with septic shock), which has the following effects:

• Arteriolar vasodilation causes decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and consequent hypotension.

• Venular vasodilation causes decreased central venous pressure (CVP) and reduces venous return to the right atrium.

• The vasculature becomes leaky, resulting in loss of intravascular volume that further contributes to both hypotension and decreased CVP.

With reduced venous return to the right atrium, right ventricular output and blood delivery to the left atrium and left ventricle are reduced. This leads to decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), a reflection of left atrial pressure. Despite the reduced left ventricular preload, cardiac output is commonly normal or increased in early distributive shock due to both the large decrease in SVR and a baroreceptor reflex-mediated increase in heart rate (ie, tachycardia).

(Choice B) Hypovolemic shock involves massive intravascular volume depletion, leading to decreased CVP and PCWP. SVR is reflexively increased in response to reduced cardiac output and hypotension.

(Choice C) Obstructive shock most commonly involves an obstruction to blood flow between the right atrium and the pulmonary capillaries (eg, pulmonary embolism). CVP is increased, PCWP is decreased, and there is a reflexive increase in SVR.

(Choice D) Cardiogenic shock results from left ventricular failure. CVP and PCWP are increased due to backward transmission of increased pressure, and there is a reflexive increase in SVR.

A 65-year-old man with exertional chest pain and an abnormal exercise stress test comes to the hospital for elective cardiac catheterization. The patient has no resting chest pain or shortness of breath. He has no known allergies. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respirations are 15/min. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Examination shows normal jugular venous pressure, clear lungs without crackles, normal heart sounds, no murmurs, and a normal capillary refill time. Ten minutes after the first injection of iodinated contrast during cardiac catheterization, the patient reports chest pain, abdominal pain, and dizziness; then he suddenly becomes obtunded and flushed. Blood pressure is 70/36 mm Hg, pulse is 128/min, and respirations are 32/min. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 90% on 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.

• Arteriolar vasodilation causes decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and consequent hypotension.

• Venular vasodilation causes decreased central venous pressure (CVP) and reduces venous return to the right atrium.

• The vasculature becomes leaky, resulting in loss of intravascular volume that further contributes to both hypotension and decreased CVP.

With reduced venous return to the right atrium, right ventricular output and blood delivery to the left atrium and left ventricle are reduced. This leads to decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), a reflection of left atrial pressure. Despite the reduced left ventricular preload, cardiac output is commonly normal or increased in early distributive shock due to both the large decrease in SVR and a baroreceptor reflex-mediated increase in heart rate (ie, tachycardia).

(Choice B) Hypovolemic shock involves massive intravascular volume depletion, leading to decreased CVP and PCWP. SVR is reflexively increased in response to reduced cardiac output and hypotension.

(Choice C) Obstructive shock most commonly involves an obstruction to blood flow between the right atrium and the pulmonary capillaries (eg, pulmonary embolism). CVP is increased, PCWP is decreased, and there is a reflexive increase in SVR.

(Choice D) Cardiogenic shock results from left ventricular failure. CVP and PCWP are increased due to backward transmission of increased pressure, and there is a reflexive increase in SVR.

Anaphylaxis and anaphylaxis-like reactions can cause distributive shock due to the widespread release of inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine) that incites massive peripheral vasodilation. Arteriolar vasodilation decreases systemic vascular resistance to cause hypotension, and venular vasodilation decreases central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

This patient with refractory hypotension, tachycardia, and jugular venous distension likely has acute cardiac tamponade (due to blunt cardiac injury from the collision). Cardiac tamponade is classified as acute or subacute based on the rate and volume of pericardia! fluid accumulation.

Version

Subacute tamponade typically develops from chronic processes that cause the slow accumulation of pericardia! fluid (eg, malignancy, renal failure), giving the pericardium time to progressively stretch. The pericardium may accommodate 1-2 L of fluid before intrapericardial pressure rises and compromises cardiac function. This large quantity of pericardia! fluid causes the classic globular cardiac silhouette on x-ray.

In contrast, acute tamponade occurs due to rapid fluid accumulation (eg, accumulation of blood due to blunt cardiac injury in this patient). Because the stiff pericardium does not have time to adapt, a small amount of pericardial fluid (eg, 100-200 ml) can dramatically increase intrapericardial pressure without causing cardiomegaly on x-ray (typically seen with >200 ml). Therefore, acute tamponade is associated with normal cardiac contours, as in this patient.

Therefore, acute tamponade is associated with n,ormal cardiac contours, as in this patient.

A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was found unresponsive at the scene and intubated by the paramedics, who also administered 2 L of normal saline. He was the unrestrained driver. Upon arrival, blood pressure is 72/54 mm Hg, and pulse is 120/min. The patient responds to strong vocal and tactile stimuli by opening his eyes. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Neck veins are distended. There are multiple bruises involving the anterior chest and upper abdomen. Chest x-ray reveals a small, left-sided pleural effusion and normal cardiac contours. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

On physical examination, patients may have hypotension with elevated jugular venous pressure (obstructive shock due to the pericardia! fluid preventing adequate cardiac contraction) as well as muffled heart sounds (Beck triad, only seen in a minority of patients). This patient's small, left-sided pleural effusion may be due to blood leaking from the pericardium (eg, through a small tear) or a concomitant injury (eg, lacerated lung parenchyma).

A. Aortic rupture (18%)

B. Bronchial rupture (3%)

C. Cardiac tamponade (60%)

D. Esophageal rupture (3%)

E. Lung contusion ( 14°/o)

(Choice A) Aortic rupture is often immediately fatal. In rare instances, aortic rupture with bleeding into the left pleural space that has been contained (eg, by a hematoma) can present with left-sided pleural effusion and hypotension. However, it would cause hypovolemic (rather than obstructive) hypotension with flat (rather than distended) neck veins.

(Choice B) Traumatic bronchial rupture (air leaking from the tracheobronchial tree into the pleural space) can cause hypotension and jugular venous distension. However, this typically occurs with massive extrapulmonary air leakage, which would be associated with tension pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema (not seen on this patient's x-ray).

(Choice D) Esophageal rupture can allow efflux of gastrointestinal contents into the pleural space (causing pleural effusion) and mediastinum (causing mediastinitis, a systemic inflammatory response, and vasodilatory hypotension). However, flat (rather than distended) neck veins would be expected due to peripheral vasodilation.

Version

(Choice E) Lung contusion that injures the lung parenchyma and visceral pleura can bleed into the pleural space, causing left-sided pleural effusion. However, lung contusion with bleeding sufficient to cause hypotension (from hypovolemia) would be associated with flat (rather than distended) neck veins.

Educational objective:

Acute cardiac tamponade is due to rapid accumulation of a small amount of fluid within a stiff pericardium, causing a sudden rise in intrapericardial pressure. Unlike subacute tamponade, the cardiac silhouette can be normal on chest x-ray.

Explanation

A 46-year-old man with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease comes to the clinic after an arteriovenous fistula was placed 2 weeks ago in preparation for hemodialysis. He is feeling well and has no concerns. The surgical site shows good healing with no evidence of infection. Doppler interrogation shows high fistula flow rates. Compared to the presurgical state, which of the following is most likely present in this patient?

Afterload

Preload

Cardiac output

Hemodialysis access is commonly obtained through a surgically created arteriovenous fistula. The fistula forms an enlarged vein, which serves as an access point and facilitates adequate blood flow to and from the hemodialysis machine.

An arteriovenous fistula also causes hemodynamic changes. Because the fistula allows a portion of blood to bypass the high resistance of the systemic arterioles, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is effectively decreased (decreased afterload). In addition, blood passing through the fistula returns to the right atrium more quickly and easily, creating an increase in venous return (increased preload). Both the increased venous return and decreased SVR contribute to increased cardiac output (CO); decreased SVR necessitates an increase in CO to maintain organ perfusion pressure (mean arterial blood pressure = CO x SVR).

Marked changes in these hemodynamic parameters can lead to high-output heart failure; therefore, care must be taken to ensure that a surgically created arteriovenous fistula is not too large.

(10/o)

(Choices A and B) Sepsis involves a decrease in both afterload and preload. CO is initially increased but eventually decreases in late sepsis when tissue ischemia and the accumulation of cytotoxic mediators begin to depress cardiac contractility and heart rate.

(Choice D) Administration of an adrenergic agent affecting both alpha and beta receptors (eg, epinephrine) leads to venoconstriction, arterioconstriction, and increased contractility to increase preload, afterload, and CO.

Version

(Choice E) Hypovolemia causes decreased preload with a resulting decrease in CO and a responsive increase in SVR (afterload).

(Choice F) Increased afterload and preload with decreased CO is seen with decompensated heart failure resulting from left ventricular dysfunction (low-output heart failure).

Educational objective:

An arteriovenous fistula allows blood to bypass the high-resistance systemic capillaries, resulting in decreased systemic vascular resistance (afterload), increased venous return (preload), and increased cardiac output. A large arteriovenous fistula can lead to high-output heart failure.

The femoral artery is the most common vascular access point in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. A number of local complications can occur; this patient has likely developed an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The femoral vein can be inadvertently punctured during needle insertion attempts to obtain femoral arterial access. Following the procedure, inadequate hemostasis may allow persistent bleeding from the arterial puncture site to track into the venous puncture site, creating an AVF.

Most patients are initially asymptomatic but gradually develop mild swelling and localized

There is mild swelling in the right inguinal area with a palpable thrill and a continuous murmur on auscultation. Lower extremity deep tendon reflexes are normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current findings?

Q A. Abnormal arteriovenous communication (56%) Q B. Arterial pseudoaneurysm formation (30%)

✓

Most patients are initially asymptomatic but gradually develop mild swelling and localized tenderness. As arterial pressure exceeds venous pressure throughout the cardiac cycle, a continuous bruit with a palpable thrill is typically present. In addition, distal pulses may be diminished in the affected extremity. An untreated AVF can progressively enlarge and lead to limb edema (due to venous hypertension), limb ischemia (due to redirection of arterial blood flow), and high-output heart failure (due to blood returning to the right atrium without passing through peripheral resistance).

The diagnosis is typically confirmed by duplex ultrasound. Management of small AVFs involves observation (sometimes resulting in spontaneous closure) or ultrasound-guided compression. Large AVFs typically require surgical repair.

(Choice B) Femoral artery pseudoaneurysm develops when an inadequately sealed arterial puncture site leads to a hematoma contained within periarterial connective tissue. Ongoing communication with the arterial lumen creates a tender, pulsatile mass with an audible systolic (rather than a continuous) bruit.

(Choices C and G) Atherosclerotic arterial occlusion and deep venous thrombosis are not typical complications of cardiac catheterization, and a continuous bruit with a palpable thrill would not be expected.

Q Q Q Q Q

C. Atherosclerotic arterial occlusion (4%)

D. Bleeding into the retroperitoneum (2%)

E. Iatrogenic peripheral nerve injury (0°/o)

F. Separation of arterial wall layers (4%)

G. Thrombotic deep venous occlusion (1%)

(Choice D) A potentially fatal complication of cardiac catheterization is an expanding hematoma with extension into the retroperitoneum. Patients typically have flank pain and hypotension within 24 hours of the procedure.

(Choice E) Iatrogenic peripheral nerve injury can occur during vascular access due to close proximity of the femoral artery and femoral nerve. Discomfort or paresthesias in the ipsilateral thigh accompanied by patellar tendon hyporeflexia would be expected.

This patient with a penetrating injury to the anteromedial portion of the upper thigh and hard evidence of vascular injury should undergo prompt surgical exploration. The initial evaluation and management of patients with severe extremity injury includes hemorrhage control, radiography of skeletal injuries, and evaluation of the neurovascular bundle. Vascular assessment should focus on identifying hard signs of injury, including:

• Observed pulsatile bleeding

• Presence of a bruit or thrill over the injury

• Expanding hematoma

If hard signs are absent, further evaluation for soft signs (eg, history of hemorrhage, diminished pulses, bony injury, neurologic abnormality) shoulld occur. If present, these signs indicate the need for additional testing such as the injured extremity index (similar to ankle-brachia! index), which involves comparing the systolic occlusion pressure distally in an injured extremity to the occlusion pressure at a proximal site in an uninjured extremity. If the index is abnormal (<0.9), patients should be considered for CT scan or conventional arteriography and surgery in conjunction with management of other injuries (eg, bony damage) (Choice C).

Educational objective:

Hard signs of vascular injury include pulsatile bleeding, bruits or thrills over the injury, an expanding hematoma, and signs of distal ischemia (eg, absent pulses, cool extremities). In the presence of a penetrating injury, such signs are almost universally predictive of the need for urgent surgical repair.

A 64-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to fever, chills, flank pain, and lethargy for the past 2 days. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 120/min. The patient has right costovertebral angle tenderness. Leukocytes are 16,000/mm 3 and urinalysis shows pyuria, many bacteria, and positive nitrites. ECG shows sinus tachycardia. A central venous catheter placement is planned for intravenous therapy and hemodynamic monitoring. After the patient's chest is appropriately prepared and draped, a needle is inserted just lateral to the angle of the left clavicle and a triple lumen catheter is placed into the left subclavian vein. Each lumen is flushed with sterile saline after obtaining blood return. The catheter is sutured in place to the skin and a sterile dressing is applied. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

A central venous catheter (CVC) is commonly used for the administration of critical care medications (eg, pressers, hypertonic saline) and in the setting of difficult vascular access or need for long-term medication (eg, chemotherapy). The preferred points of central venous access are the internal jugular vein (typically by ultrasound guidance) or the subclavian vein (typically by anatomic landmark guidance). CVC complications occur in up to 15°/oof cases, and many are due to inappropriate catheter placement.

Q A. Antibiotic through the catheter (12%)

0

B. Bedside echocardiography (2%)

Q ✓ Q

C. Fluid bolus through the catheter (13%)

D. Portable chest radiograph (69%)

The ideal placement of a CVC tip is in the lower superior vena cava. Tip placement in smaller veins (eg, subclavian, jugular, azygous) predisposes to venous perforation. In addition, inappropriately placed catheter tips may cause lung puncture, leading to pneumothorax, or myocardial perforation, leading to pericardial tamponade. Arterial (eg, subclavian) puncture is also a risk, particularly in the absence of ultrasound guidance.

Q

E. Repeat ECG (1%)

Confirmatory chest x-ray may be omitted in the setting of an uncomplicated (eg, first needle insertion, no resistance to catheter advancement) ultrasound-guided CVC placement. Otherwise, a portable chest x-ray should be performed immediately following CVC placement to facilitate timely recognition of a misplaced catheter tip, identify possible injury (eg, pneumothorax), and prevent exacerbation of injury (eg, infusion of fluid into the pericardia! space). Visualization of the catheter tip just proximal to the angle between the trachea and right mainstem bronchus confirms appropriate placement.

Patients in critical care settings are typically on continuous telemetry that will detect cardiac arrhythmia. In the absence of continuous telemetry, patients should be monitored for hemodynamic instability (eg, tachycardia, hypotension) during and after catheter placement, but routine ECG is not indicated.

A 40-year-old woman with a medical history significant for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is scheduled for elective hysterectomy under general anesthesia due to large, symptomatic uterine fibroids and blood loss anemia. At baseline, the patient develops mild dyspnea with moderate exercise. She takes metoprolol. Blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg and pulse is 65/min. Examination shows clear lungs and a midsystolic murmur. There is no jugular venous distension or peripheral edema. During anesthesia, which of the following is recommended to prevent perioperative complications in this patient?

Explanation

Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction that, when severe, can drastically limit cardiac output. The degree of LVOT obstruction is worsened by low LV blood volume; therefore, hemodynamics should be optimized to encourage high LV blood volume throughout the cardiac cycle (ie, both end-diastolic and end-systolic):

C. Avoiding perioperative beta blockers (23%)

D. Ensuring adequate intravenous hydration (61%)

E. Maintaining high peak airway pressures (6%)

• High LV end-diastolic volume (ie, high preload) is encouraged by adequate hydration and avoidance of venous dilators (eg, nitroglycerin). Maintaining a relatively low heart rate is also beneficial as it lengthens diastolic filling time to increase end-diastolic volume.

• High LV end-systolic volume is encouraged by a relatively low stroke volume (SV). A relatively low SV, whether from low contractility or high afterload (pressure that the left ventricle must contract against), leads to blood being ejected (during systole) at a higher LV blood volume. This higher LV blood volume minimizes LVOT obstruction, allowing for more effective cardiac output. In contrast, if end-systolic volume gets too low, there is a precipitous drop in SV, leading to severe LVOT obstruction.

Version

Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) are highly useful in treating HCM because they decrease heart rate to lengthen diastolic filling time and increase LV end-diastolic volume; and they decrease LV contractility to increase LV end-systolic volume. These effects help minimize LVOT obstruction (Choice C).

(Choice A) Dobutamine primarily stimulates beta-1 receptors. The increased heart rate and contractility caused by beta-1 stimulation decrease LV end-diastolic and LV end-systolic volume, respectively, and can worsen LVOT obstruction in HCM.

(Choice B) Norepinephrine stimulates alpha-1 and beta-1 receptors. The peripheral vasoconstriction and resulting increased LV afterlload (induced by alpha-1 stimulation) are beneficial for LVOT obstruction in HCM, but the increased heart rate and contractility (induced by beta-1 stimulation) worsen the obstruction and outweigh the positive effect.

A 68-year-old man comes for outpatient follow-up after recent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. He describes anterior chest "clicking" and "shifting" when he bends or moves his upper extremities. The patient has no chest pain, dyspnea, fever, chills, or abdominal pain. He underwent uncomplicated surgery with internal thoracic artery harvesting 6 days ago for severe coronary artery disease. The patient is afebrile, and vital signs are within normal limits. Medical history includes diabetes mellitus, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Examination reveals a midsternal wound that is clean with well-approximated sutures and minimal serous discharge at the lower edge but without erythema. On palpation the sternum appears to be rocking and clicking with patient coughing. Which of the following is the best management for this patient?

Explanation

This patient's presentation is concerning for sternal dehiscence, a complication of cardiac surgery that occurs when the 2 approximated edges of the bony sternum separate, typically due to loosening or fracture of the suture wire. It can occur with or without the involvement of superficial soft tissues (ie, superficial dehiscence) or concurrent deep wound infection (ie, mediastinitis ). Patients may have mild pain or sensation of chest wall instability and "clicking" with chest movement. The diagnosis can be made radiographically (eg, displaced sternal wires) or clinically; palpable rocking or clicking of the sternum confirms the diagnosis.

A. Clinical observation only (35%)

B. Compressive sternal dressing (15%)

C. Negative pressure wound therapy (2°/o)

D. Oral antibiotics (0%)

E. Surgical exploration and sternal fixation (45%)

Risk factors are related to impaired wound healing. Obesity, macromastia (large breasts), and the sequelae of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (eg, barrel chest deformity, chronic cough) increase tensile forces on the wound closure, predisposing patients to sternal separation. Internal thoracic artery harvesting can result in sternal ischemia, whereas patients with diabetes or who smoke are at risk for poor wound healing and infection.

✓ O

Sternal dehiscence is a surgical emergency and requires urgent surgical exploration, debridement, and sternal fixation to prevent cardiac damage from loose wire or bone fragments. Patients without evidence of underlying infection can undergo rewiring or sternal plate placement to stabilize the sternum.

(Choice A) Sternal dehiscence is a surgical emergency and clinical observation without surgical intervention risks increases in patient morbidity and mortality.

(Choices B and C) Compressive sternal dressings and negative pressure wound therapy are frequently used in patients with sternal wound failure to protect the wound and speed its healing. However, this patient has palpable rocking of the sternum consistent with sternal dehiscence and therefore requires surgical intervention and sternal fixation to prevent cardiac injury.

(Choice D) Blood and wound cultures and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are indicated if there is concern for infection; however, empiric oral antibiotics should be avoided due to the high mortality risk associated with deep sternal wound infection. In addition, this patient does not have signs of infection (ie, fever, chills, erythema on examination), and fixation of the mobile sternum is more appropriate.

Correct answer

(Choices B and C) Compressive sternal dressings and negative pressure wound therapy are frequently used in patients with sternal wound failure to protect the wound and speed its healing. However, this patient has palpable rocking of the sternum consistent with sternal dehiscence and therefore requires surgical intervention and sternal fixation to prevent cardiac injury.

(Choice D) Blood and wound cultures and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are indicated if there is concern for infection; however, empiric oral antibiotics should be avoided due to the high mortality risk associated with deep sternal wound infection. In addition, this patient does not have signs of infection (ie, fever, chills, erythema on examination), and fixation of the mobile sternum is more appropriate.

Sternal dehiscence is a complication of cardiac surgery characterized by separation of the bony edges of the sternum. Patients may report mild pain or sensation of chest wall instability and "clicking" with chest movement. The diagnosis can be made radiographically (eg, displaced sternal wire) or clinically; palpable rocking or clicking of the sternum confirms the diagnosis. Management involves urgent surgical exploration and repair.

0 ✓ Q

A. Chest tube placement (0%)

B. CT angiography of the chest (65°/o)

This patient with evidence of blunt chest trauma (eg, sternal bruising) following rapid deceleration (fall >3 m [10 ft] onto pavement) is at risk for blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI). Rapid deceleration exerts stretching, shearing, and torsional forces capable of rupturing the aorta. The aortic isthmus-the transition zone between the relatively mobile ascending aorta/arch and the fixed descending aorta-is particularly vulnerable to these forces and the most common site of BTAI.

Complete aortic rupture (ie, tear of the intima, media, and adventitia) typically results in rapid exsanguination and death. This patient who survived the fall likely has an incomplete rupture (ie, tear of the intima ± media), which may result in:

• Creation of a secondary, false lumen similar to aortic dissection

• Creation of an obstructive intimal flap or intramural hematoma that impedes distal blood flow (pseudocoarctation), resulting in proximal hypertension and distal hypotension (eg, upper extremity hypertension with diminished femoral pulses)

• Expansion of the adventitia under high-flow pressure, causing compression/stretching of surrounding structures such as the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (eg, hoarse voice)

C. Esophagography (2%)

F. Transthoracic echocardiography (26%)

CT angiography of the chest is highly sensitive and specific for thoracic aortic injury and is readily available. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can also evaluate the thoracic aorta but requires an experienced echocardiographer. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) does not adequately visualize the thoracic aorta, which progressively becomes a more posterior anatomical structure (closer to the esophagus) as it arches and transitions into the descending aorta (Choice F). Incomplete rupture should prompt emergent surgical evaluation.

A 48-year-old woman comes to the hospital for elective cholecystectomy. The patient has had postprandial upper abdominal pain and nausea for the past several months, and ultrasonography revealed gallstones. After discussion of risks and benefits, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned. Her other medical conditions include obesity and hypertension. In preparation for the surgery, general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation is administered. Immediately after a needle is placed into the intraperitoneal space and CO 2 gas insufflation is performed, severe sinus bradycardia and transient atrioventricular block is noted. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the observed intraoperative finding in this patient?

Explanation

Laparoscopic intervention is a minimally invasive option for a number of intraabdominal surgeries (eg, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy). Preparation for the surgery requires insufflation of CO 2 gas into the abdominal cavity to create space for surgical maneuvering and to facilitate adequate camera visibility during the procedure. CO 2 is introduced into the abdomen via a needle or port, with continuous monitoring of intraabdominal pressure.

A. CO 2 gas embolization (13%)

B. Inadequate anesthesia (3%)

C. Peritoneal stretching (39%)

D. Systemic CO 2 absorption (15°/4,)

E. Vena cava compression (27%)

Peritoneal stretch receptors sense the increase in intraabdominal pressure and respond by triggering increased vagal tone. Close monitoring is required as patients may develop severe bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and sometimes asystole. The increased intraabdominal pressure can also cause a mechanical increase in systemic vascular resistance leading to elevations in blood pressure.

A 72-year-old man undergoes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) for severe coronary artery disease. He is extubated on the second postoperative day. His temperature is 36.6° C (97.9° F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. On the third postoperative day, he complains of dyspnea and worsening retrosternal pain despite continuous analgesia with morphine. His temperature is 38.6° C (101.5° F), blood pressure is 112/52 mm Hg, pulse is 125/min and irregularly irregular, and respirations are 28/min. Examination shows normal heart sounds. A small amount of cloudy fluid is present in the sternal wound drain. His ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. An x-ray film of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. Echocardiography reveals a small amount of pericardia! fluid. Laboratory studies show:

Explanation

This patient presents with findings consistent with likely acute mediastinitis, a possible complication of cardiac surgery that is usually due to intraoperative wound contamination. Mediastinitis can complicate up to 5% of sternotomies. Patients typically present postoperatively (usually within 14 days) with fever, tachycardia, chest pain, leukocytosis, and sternal wound drainage or purulent discharge (as in this patient).

Chest x-ray usually shows a widened mediastinum in non-postoperative mediastinitis, but this can also be seen in postoperative mediastinitis after cardiac surgery. The diagnosis is usually clinically made and confirmed during surgery when pus is noted in the mediastinum. Postoperative mediastinitis requires drainage, surgical debridement with immediate closure, and prolonged antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics alone do not appropriately treat mediastinitis (Choice B). Acute mediastinitis has a mortality rate of 10%-50%, even with appropriate treatment.

Which of the following will this patient most likely require?

(Choice A) Atrial fibrillation commonly (up to 15%-40%) occurs within a few days after CABG and is usually self-limited, with resolution in <24 hours. Rate control with beta-blockers or amiodarone is best. Anticoagulation and/or cardioversion is reserved for patients with atrial fibrillation lasting >24 hours after CABG. Since this patient requires immediate surgery anticoagulation should not be given.

This patient with acute-onset, left-sided weakness and a left atrial mass identified on echocardiography likely has an atrial myxoma. Myxomas are benign tumors and are the most common primary cardiac neoplasm; approximately 80% arise in the left atrium. Fragments of a left atrial myxoma can embolize into the systemic circulation, leading to stroke or other acute ischemia (eg, limb, mesenteric).

Left atrial myxomas frequently obstruct blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle, leading to a murmur mimicking that of mitral stenosis (ie, middiastolic rumble at the apex). The obstruction can also lead to decreased cardiac output that manifests as dyspnea, lightheadedness, or syncope. Because the mass is typically mobile, obstructive symptoms may be transient and influenced by position (ie, mitral obstruction is exacerbated by upright posture but is alleviated by lying down); tumor movement occasionally causes a characteristic "tumor plop" sound at the end of diastole on auscultation. In addition, some myxomas can produce cytokines (eg, IL-6) that lead to systemic inflammation (evidenced by an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss).

The diagnosis is typically established by echocardiography. Prompt surgical resection is recommended to minimize the risk of embolization and sudden cardiac death (due to impaired cardiac output).

In addition, infective endocarditis typically causes a regurgitant rather than stenotic murmur.

(Choice C) Left atrial thrombus can develop in atrial fibrillation and lead to systemic embolization. However, this patient's history of low-grade fevers, weight loss, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are more consistent with myxoma.

(Choice D) Myxomatous valve degeneration is the pathologic cause of mitral valve prolapse, which characteristically produces a midsystolic click rather than middiastolic rumble.

(Choice E) Worldwide, rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of mitral stenosis, which produces a middiastolic rumble and can lead to atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus with systemic embolization. However, rheumatic heart disease is uncommon in developed countries. In addition, mitral stenosis typically develops years after the initial episode of rheumatic fever; recurrent episodes are rare in adults and usually involve pharyngitis.

Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac neoplasm and usually arise in the left atrium. Fragments of the tumor can dislodge and lead to systemic embolization (eg, stroke, acute limb ischemia). The tumors may also cause position-dependent obstruction of the mitral valve, leading to a middiastolic murmur and symptoms of decreased cardiac output (eg, dyspnea, syncope). Constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss) may also be present.

A 65-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to sudden-onset chest pain followed by syncope. The pain started an hour ago, during which he had an episode of syncope lasting 1-2 minutes. The patient has had no dyspnea or palpitations. He has never had similar symptoms before. Medical history is significant for hypertension and a 40-pack-year smoking history. Blood pressure is 190/110 mm Hg in both arms; pulse is 100/min and regular; and respirations are 24/min. Pulses are symmetric and equal in all extremities. Jugular venous pressure is normal. Breath sounds are normal on both sides. There is an S4 gallop. ECG shows changes consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy. Serum troponin is normal. D-dimer is elevated. Chest x-ray shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette but is otherwise unremarkable. CT scan of the chest is obtained and is shown below:

Aortic dissection

The most common symptom of acute aortic dissection is sudden-onset chest or back pain that is typically severe, sharp, and tearing. Complications of type A dissections, including syncope, stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure, depend on the vessels and structures involved (eg, subclavian or carotid arteries, coronary artery ostia, aortic root). Additional signs may include asymmetry of upper extremity blood pressures, hypotension, and aortic regurgitation. D-dimer elevation (sensitive but not specific) is frequently seen due to the presence of fibrin degradation products. ECG findings depend on underlying comorbidities (eg, hypertension) and on whether the coronary ostia have been compromised. Plain radiographs may demonstrate a widened cardiac silhouette; CT angiography confirms the diagnosis, often revealing an intimal flap and double lumen.

Type A dissections have a very high mortality rate in the absence of immediate surgical intervention. lntraoperative transesophageal echocardiography is frequently performed to identify further abnormalities that may require intervention including aortic root/valve damage or tamponade.

(Choices A and D) Early identification of aortic dissection is essential because therapies for similarly presenting conditions (eg, aspirin and heparin for myocardial infarction; thrombolytics for pulmonary embolism or ischemic stroke) worsen outcomes and are contraindicated. In this patient, the normal troponin, the lack of acute ECG changes, and the presence of imaging findings consistent with dissection make myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism unlikely.

(Choice B) Type B dissections that do not result in malperfusion to thoracic or abdominal organs (eg, mesenteric ischemia) may be managed medically with pain and blood pressure control. Type B dissections complicated by organ malperfusion benefit from urgent surgical or endovascular repair.

(Choice E) Coronary angiography is a useful diagnostic measure in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, which would cause acute ECG changes and a troponin elevation. It does not have a role in type A aortic dissection because it delays definitive surgical management.

Educational objective:

Type A dissections involve the ascending aorta and present with sudden-onset chest or back pain that is severe and described as sharp or tearing. They may be complicated by syncope, stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure and require immediate surgical intervention.

Most arterial emboli originate from the heart. Potential cardiac sources include left atrial thrombus (eg, atrial fibrillation), left ventricular (LV) thrombus (eg, LV aneurysm), infective endocarditis (ie, septic emboli), and prosthetic valve thrombosis. Given this patient's recent severe (ie, causing cardiogenic shock) anterior myocardial infarction, formation of an LV aneurysm is the most likely cause; when the infarcted muscle fails to contract (or even balloons outward) during systole, stasis of adjacent blood can form an LV thrombus capable of subsequent embolization.

In patients with shock, a central venous catheter is often placed to facilitate fluid administration. It also allows measurement of central venous pressure (CVP), which is the pressure in the superior vena cava (SVC) where the catheter tip is located. Because SVC pressure approximates right atrial pressure, CVP provides an estimate of cardiac preload.

• A low CVP (low preload) typically reflects hypovolemic or distributive shock.

• An elevated CVP (high preload) typically reflects cardiogenic or obstructive shock.

Version

In the trauma setting, shock is first assumed to be due to hypovolemia (ie, hemorrhage), which would cause low CVP. However, this patient has elevated CVP; therefore, a source of cardiogenic or obstructive (rather than hypovolemic) shock should be sought (Choice C). Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) due to blunt chest trauma can lead to cardiogenic shock (with acute right heart dysfunction causing elevated CVP and left heart dysfunction causing refractory hypotension) or to obstructive shock (eg, cardiac tamponade). Other manifestations of BCI can include arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and valve or wall rupture.

This patient with chest pain likely has underlying Turner syndrome (TS}, a genetic condition caused by partial or complete loss of an X chromosome. Short stature is nearly universal in patients with TS because the X chromosome contains critical genes for linear growth in females. Most patients have gonadal dysgenesis leading to primary ovarian insufficiency and amenorrhea. Musculoskeletal abnormalities include webbed neck, broad chest, micrognathia, short fourth metacarpals, cubitus valgus, and scoliosis.

Version

Acute severe chest pain in patients with suspected TS should raise concern for aortic dissection, a life-threatening comorbidity. Acute dissection typically presents with sharp or tearing pain in the chest or back that can radiate to the neck or abdomen; asymmetric upper extremity pulses or blood pressures can occur. Although dissection can develop in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities, the risk is higher in patients with cardiovascular

An 18-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to severe chest pain. The pain began abruptly 1 hour ago and is sharp and constant. The patient was recently evaluated by a gynecologist for primary amenorrhea but reports no other medical conditions and takes no medications. She immigrated to the United States 2 years ago as a political refugee; she did not have access to adequate medical care in childhood. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Blood pressure is 166/92 mm Hg and pulse is 103/min. Height is 142 cm (4 ft 8 in). On physical examination, the patient appears to be in moderate discomfort. Jugular veins are not distended, and the lungs are clear on auscultation. Cardiac examination reveals a systolic ejection murmur. Micrognathia, cubitus valgus deformity, and scoliosis are noted. ECG shows sinus tachycardia without STsegment changes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?

A.

extremity pulses or blood pressures can occur. Although dissection can develop in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities, the risk is higher in patients with cardiovascular manifestations of TS, including bicuspid aortic valve (which can cause a systolic ejection murmur), aortic root dilation, aortic coarctation, or hypertension. The diagnosis of aortic dissection is confirmed on imaging (eg, CT angiography).

All patients with TS should undergo regular screening for aortic dilation with transthoracic echocardiography and/or cardiac MRI. Measures to prevent dissection include antihypertensive medication and exercise restriction.

(Choice B) Although myocardial infarction (coronary thrombosis) can present with acute chest pain and patients with TS have an increased incidence of coronary artery disease, aortic dissection is more likely in this young patient. In addition, the absence of ST-segment changes on the ECG makes myocardial infarction less likely.

E. Spontaneous pneumothorax (1 %)

(Choice C) Acute chest pain with mitral regurgitation and heart failure can occur due to flail mitral leaflet, but a holosystolic (not systolic ejection) murmur would be expected. Moreover, this condition is associated with mitral valve prolapse, endocarditis, and papillary muscle rupture, none of which is typical in TS.

(Choice D) Estrogen therapy increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, which can present with chest pain and tachycardia. However, the pain is typically pleuritic (rather than constant) and associated with shortness of breath. This patient is not taking any medications, and pulmonary embolism is not a typical complication of TS.

A 34-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to acute-onset central chest and epigastric pain radiating to the mid-lower back. The pain started an hour ago while at rest. The patient also reports mild shortness of breath and diaphoresis. He has not seen a physician in 10 years. The patient drinks 3 or 4 beers most days and occasionally uses cocaine. His last use of cocaine was a day ago. On examination, the patient is in severe distress due to pain. Skin is cool and clammy. Blood pressure is 210/120 mm Hg and equal in both arms. Pulse is 110/min and regular, and respirations are 22/min. Pulse oximetry shows 95% on room air. BMI is 34 kg/m . 2 There is no pulse asymmetry. Jugular venous pressure is normal. Breath sounds are decreased at the left lower base, and percussion is dull in the same area. Heart sounds are normal with no murmurs or extra sounds. Abdominal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. Extremities have no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. ECG reveals sinus tachycardia with nonspecific T-wave changes. Serum troponin is normal. D-dimer is elevated. Serum lipase is normal. Chest x-ray shows a moderate-sized left pleural effusion. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's current condition?

This patient likely has acute aortic dissection complicated by pleural effusion. Risk factors for aortic dissection include hypertension, connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome), and preexisting aneurysm. Cocaine, which can cause rapid and transient hypertension, is frequently associated with dissections in young patients.

✓ O

Patients typically have sudden-onset, severe chest or back pain that is described as sharp or tearing. Depending on the vessels and structures involved (eg, carotid arteries, aortic root, celiac artery), complications can include stroke, acute aortic regurgitation with heart failure, or mesenteric ischemia. Involvement of the subclavian or iliac arteries can result in asymmetry of pulses or blood pressure (pulses and blood pressure are typically symmetric if these arterial branches are not involved). Pleural effusion may occur due to either direct extension causing hemothorax or from an inflammatory reaction to blood irritating the pleural lining.

This young patient with chronic back pain and intermittent bilateral heel pain (ie, enthesitis ), as well as impaired spinal mobility and limited chest wall expansion, most likely has ankylosing spondylitis, a rheumatologic disease primarily involving inflammatory arthritis of the spine. Limited chest wall expansion does not fully explain his exertional shortness of breath and significantly reducing exercise capacity and does not account for a laterally displaced point of maximal apical impulse (PMI); therefore, this patient is likely developing heart failure due to chronic aortic regurgitation, a potential complication of ankylosing spondylitis.

Aortic regurgitation occurs in up to 10°/oof patients with ankylosing spondylitis. It likely results from chronic inflammation of the aortic root and valve cusps, resulting in retraction of the valve cusps and consequent impaired valve closure. Over time, aortic regurgitation causes left ventricular volume overload with compensatory eccentric hypertrophy and lateral displacement of the PMI. Rarely, the chronic inflammation can extend into the interventricular septum and cause conduction abnormalities (eg, advanced atrioventricular block) as well.

Explanation

This patient with untreated hyperthyroidism has new-onset fever, severe hypertension, and tachycardia following appendectomy. This presentation raises concern for thyroid storm (ie, severe overactivity of thyroid hormone). Nonadherence with antithyroid drugs (eg, methimazole) and acutely stressful events (eg, surgery, trauma, infection) are common precipitants of thyroid storm.

The hemodynamics of thyroid storm involve the following:

• Reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR): Thyroid hormone causes increased metabolic demand in the tissues and has a direct vasodilatory effect on the endothelium; these effects result in peripheral vasodilation and reduced SVR.

E.

Normal

Normal

• Increased cardiac output (ie, cardiac index): In response to the reduced SVR, a reflexive increase in myocardial contractility and heart rate occurs. In addition, thyroid hormone has a direct sympathetic-like effect on the myocardium, further increasing contractility and heart rate. Stroke volume is markedly increased, which increases pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure. The increases in stroke volume and heart rate increase cardiac output and cause hyperdynamic circulation (ie, high blood flow).

• High venous oxygen content: The hyperdynamic circulation allows less time for the tissues to extract oxygen from the bloodstream, resulting in high venous oxygen content (ie, low arterial-venous oxygen difference).

Version

Untreated hyperthyroidism can eventually lead to high-output heart failure; this develops quickly in thyroid storm. Because the increased cardiac output flows against low SVR, blood returns to the heart quickly and easily and venous return is markedly increased. Despite a sustained elevation in cardiac output, the left ventricle cannot keep up with the increased venous return and pressure backs up into the lungs, causing increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary edema.

precipitants of thyroid storm.

A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to right lower quadrant pain and is diagnosed with acute appendicitis. The patient is admitted to the hospital after undergoing an emergency appendectomy. He has a history of Graves disease treated with methimazole but has not been taking his medications regularly. One day after the procedure, the patient becomes restless, tremulous, agitated, and short of breath. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 210/110 mm Hg, and pulse is 140/min. Lung examination is notable for fine bibasilar crackles. ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following parameters are most likely to be seen on hemodynamic measurement?

The hemodynamics of thyroid storm involve the following:

• Reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR): Thyroid hormone causes increased metabolic demand in the tissues and has a direct vasodilatory effect on the endothelium; these effects result in peripheral vasodilation and reduced SVR.

• Increased cardiac output (ie, cardiac index): In response to the reduced SVR, a reflexive increase in myocardial contractility and heart rate occurs. In addition, thyroid hormone has a direct sympathetic-like effect on the myocardium, further increasing contractility and heart rate. Stroke volume is markedly increased, which increases pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure. The increases in stroke volume and heart rate increase cardiac output and cause hyperdynamic circulation (ie, high blood flow).

Untreated hyperthyroidism can eventually lead to high-output heart failure; this develops quickly in thyroid storm. Because the increased cardiac output flows against low SVR, blood returns to the heart quickly and easily and venous return is markedly increased. Despite a sustained elevation in cardiac output, the left ventricle cannot keep up with the increased venous return and pressure backs up into the lungs, causing increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary edema.

The hemodynamics of thyroid storm involve decreased systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac output, leading to hyperdynamic circulation and increased venous return to the heart. High-output heart failure quickly develops, leading to backup of pressure from the left ventricle with increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

A 65-year-old man comes to the office due to progressively worsening dyspnea and fatigue over the last 2 weeks. His lifestyle is mostly sedentary with limited activities around the house, but he has had dyspnea for the past 3 days while at rest. The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer a year ago and underwent surgical resection followed by chemotherapy. Other medical conditions include chronic kidney disease and hypertension. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 114/70 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 95°/oon room air. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There are no heart murmurs. Extremities are without edema. Laboratory studies are as follows:

Lung cancer is the most common primary tumor implicated in malignant pericardial effusion (MPE). Pericardia! involvement occurs either by direct tumor extension or metastatic spread through the blood or lymphatics. This often results in subacute (rather than rapid) accumulation of pericardial fluid accompanied by progressive stretching of the pericardium. Therefore, patients may experience only nonspecific symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue) until enough fluid accumulates (typically 1-2 L) to increase intrapericardial pressure and compromise cardiac function (ie, cardiac tamponade).

Transthoracic echocardiography is used to establish the diagnosis of pericardia! effusion, estimate effusion volume, and assess for hemodynamic impairment (eg, right atrial and ventricular collapse). Echocardiography can also guide pericardiocentesis, which should be performed to acquire fluid for cytologic analysis whenever MPE is suspected.

(Choice A) CT angiography of the chest can assess for pulmonary embolism (PE), for which immobilization (eg, sedentary lifestyle) and malignancy are risk factors. However, dyspnea due to PE is commonly abrupt (rather than gradual) in onset, and PE would not explain an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray. In addition, CT angiography requires intravenous contrast, which is generally avoided in the setting of renal dysfunction (eg, due to chronic kidney disease).

Acute adrenal insufficiency {adrenal crisis)

Text Zoom

Settings

A 36-year-old woman is undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy due to abdominal pain, anorexia, and nausea, with intermittent vomiting and diarrhea for the past several months. She also has had fatigue and a 10-kg (22-lb) unintended weight loss during this time. Abdominal imaging studies have been unrevealing. The patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs and has no known drug allergies. Physical examination in the endoscopy unit shows normal heart and lung sounds, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, and no lower extremity edema. Propofol is administered in preparation for the endoscopy. Several minutes later, the patient suddenly becomes hypotensive. Temperature is 37 .8 C (100 F), blood pressure is 66/40 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 20/min. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. There is no wheezing or skin rash. Heart and lung sounds are normal. The hypotension fails to improve despite intravenous fluid boluses and epinephrine. Urgent laboratory results are as follows:

This patient's presentation is most consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) complicated by adrenal crisis. Her history of fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, anorexia, and gastrointestinal disturbance likely reflects PAI. PAI usually involves autoimmune destruction of all 3 layers of the adrenal cortex, leading to deficiency of mineralocorticoids (eg, aldosterone), glucocorticoids (eg, cortisol), and androgens. Therefore, common findings in chronic PAI include hyponatremia (hypovolemia-induced antidiuretic hormone secretion), hypoglycemia (cortisol deficiency), and peripheral eosinophilia (eosinophils are normally inhibited by corticosteroids), as seen in this patient.

Acutely stressful events (eg, surgery, endoscopy, injury, infection) in patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency can precipitate adrenal crisis, manifesting as severe hypotension and shock. Adrenal crisis in PAI appears to be mainly a manifestation of mineralocorticoid deficiency (hypoaldosteronism), given that it can occur even in patients taking physiologic doses of glucocorticoids. However, the resulting severe hypotension, often refractory to volume resuscitation and poorly responsive to vasopressors, is likely exacerbated by glucocorticoid deficiency because cortisol is needed to potentiate the effect of alpha-1 stimulation on peripheral vascular tone.

Treatment requires rapid volume repletion and glucocorticoid replacement (eg, intravenous dexamethasone or hydrocortisone); dexamethasone is often preferred because it does not interfere with plasma cortisol level that may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Mineralocorticoid replacement (eg, fludrocortisone) requires several days to exert its sodiumretaining effects and is typically started after initial resuscitation.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's cardiovascular collapse?

(Choice A) Gram-negative sepsis can cause profound vasodilation and severe hypotension; however, it is less likely in the absence of fever and would not explain this patient's prior abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss, or current eosinophilia. Neisseria meningitis (a gram-negative coccus) has an affinity for the adrenal glands and can cause massive adrenal hemorrhage with adrenal crisis (ie, Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome), but the presentation would be acute without preceding chronic symptoms.

This patient has typical pressure (decubitus) ulcers.Pressure ulcers are most common over bony prominences, such as the sacrum, ischial tuberosities, malleoli, heels, and 1st or 5th metatarsal head. Constant, unrelieved pressure causes necrosis of overlying skin and muscle as blood ﬂow to the soft tissues is impeded. Risk factors include impaired mobility, malnutrition, abnormal mental status (eg, dementia), decreased skin perfusion, and reduced sensation.

Initial management of pressure ulcers includes local wound care, repositioning of the patient to reduce pressure, pain control, and nutritional support. Shallow ulcers can be managed with occlusive or semipermeable dressings to maintain a moist wound environment. Full-thickness wounds may require more complex dressings and surgical intervention for debridement or closure.

(Choice A) Arterial ulcers are due to insufﬁcient blood supply that leads to tissue necrosis. They usually occur in the most distal parts of the body where blood ﬂow is lowest, such as the tips of the toes.

Which of the following is the primary cause of this patient's skin ulcers?

• A. Arterial insufﬁciency (20%)

B. Bacterial infection (1%)

C. Poor glucose control (17%)

D. Pressure necrosis (54%)

E. Venous insufﬁciency (5%)

(Choice B) Signs of bacterial infection include fever, blanching erythema, purulence, and foul odor. Although all pressure ulcers are colonized with bacteria, only clinically evident infections should be treated.

(Choice C) Diabetic foot ulcers result from chronic unnoticed trauma due to peripheral neuropathy and poor wound healing due to microvascular insufﬁciency. They often occur in association with Charcot deformity and are most common on the soles of the feet under the metatarsal heads and at the tops of the toes.

Omitted

(Choice E) Venous stasis ulcers usually occur in the setting of chronic lower-extremity edema and stasis dermatitis. They are most common at the pretibial area or above the medial malleolus.

Educational objective:

Prolonged pressure over a bony prominence can cause ischemic necrosis of overlying tissues, leading to a pressure (decubitus) ulcer. Risk factors include impaired mobility, malnutrition, abnormal mental status, decreased skin perfusion, and reduced sensation.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient's skin lesion?

Keratoacanthoma

• Rapidly growing nodule with ulceration & keratin plug

Clinical features Clinical signiﬁcance

• Often shows spontaneous regression/resolution

• May resemble or progress to squamous cell carcinoma

Management • Excisional biopsy with complete removal of lesion This patient has a keratoacanthoma, which presents as a rapidly growing nodule with ulceration and a central keratin plug. As in this patient, keratoacanthomas frequently regress and may resolve spontaneously over several months. Keratoacanthomas are most common in fair-skinned individuals and are often seen in areas of ultraviolet exposure (eg, face, forearms) or prior trauma.

Although keratoacanthomas often have a benign course, there may be a relationship to squamous cell carcinoma, with some lesions occasionally undergoing malignant transformation. For this reason, keratoacanthomas usually warrant excisional biopsy to conﬁrm the diagnosis.

(Choice A) Basal cell carcinoma often presents as an ulcerated nodule on sun-exposed skin. However, it typically grows slowly and does not undergo spontaneous regression or form a central keratin plug.

(Choice B) A cutaneous horn is a keratinaceous projection from the skin that can be seen in association with a number of benign (eg, seborrheic keratosis) and malignant (eg, squamous cell carcinoma) lesions.Cutaneous horns are typically conical or elongated and do not generally undergo rapid regression.

(Choice C) A dermatoﬁbroma is a small, ﬁrm, hyperpigmented nodule, most often located on the extremities. The lesion has a ﬁbrous component that may cause dimpling in the center

A 64-year-old woman undergoes elective inguinal hernia repair. The patient has had a left inguinal hernia for the past several years, but it recently increased in size, became more uncomfortable, and began affecting her daily activities. Medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a previous cesarean delivery. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits, and physical examination is unremarkable except for a reducible left inguinal hernia. After consideration of the surgical options, the patient undergoes a nonmesh open hernia repair with no intraoperative complications. At discharge, the patient is advised to limit strenuous physical activity to prevent wound disruption. Which of the following will provide the maximum tensile strength to this patient's wound?

After consideration of the surgical options, the patient undergoes a nonmesh open hernia repair with no intraoperative complications. At discharge, the patient is advised to limit strenuous physical activity to prevent wound disruption. Which of the following will provide the maximum tensile strength to this patient's wound?

• A. Collagen cross-linking (66%)

• Hemostasis, which occurs immediately after tissue injury, involves small vessel constriction, platelet aggregation, and clotting cascade activation, leading to hemostatic plugging and cessation of bleeding. Clot formation provides a ﬁbrin matrix scaffold for subsequent wound healing but little to no tensile strength for the wound (Choice C).

• Inﬂammation, which usually starts within hours of the injury and lasts approximately 5 days, results in increased vascular permeability and cellular recruitment (eg, neutrophils, macrophages). During this phase, there is often swelling, redness, and/or warmth of the wound and nearby soft tissues.

• B. Fibroblast proliferation (10%).

• C. Hemostatic plugging (0%).

• D. Myoﬁbroblast contraction (19%)

• E. Reepithelialization (3%)

• Proliferation begins during the inﬂammatory phase and continues afterward. During this phase, a superﬁcial epithelial layer forms to act as a barrier against bacteria. In addition, ﬁbroblasts proliferate and synthesize type Ill collagen and ground substance, forming an amorphous gel into which new capillaries can grow.This initial collagen is disorganized and without covalent cross-links, so the wound has low tensile strength

(Choice B).

• Maturation, the ﬁnal phase of wound healing that occurs between approximately 3 weeks and 2 years, results in replacement of type Ill collagen with thicker type I collagen, reorganization of collagen ﬁbers along tension lines, and covalent cross-linking of collagen subunits. These are the primary mechanisms by which the tensile strength of the wound increases.

Answered correctly

It typically takes at least 6 weeks for surgical wounds to regain most (~80%) of their original tensile strength; therefore, patients are often advised against strenuous activity during that

period.

(Choice D) During the proliferation phase, some ﬁbroblasts differentiate into myoﬁbroblasts. By contracting (via contractile proteins), myoﬁbroblasts can help approximate wound edges and/or decrease wound size; however, they do not provide signiﬁcant tensile strength to the wound.

(Choice E) The superﬁcial epithelial layer formed during reepithelialization restores the skin's protective barrier. However, it can be easily traumatized and has little tensile strength.

Answered correctly

Surgical wounds proceed through 4 phases of wound healing: hemostasis, inﬂammation, proliferation, and maturation. Collagen production begins during the proliferation phase. Collagen remodeling and cross-linking, which are most responsible for the wound's ﬁnal tensile strength, occur during the maturation phase.

This patient has an enlarging, pearly nodule with telangiectatic vessels on sun-exposed skin, concerning for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is the most common skin cancer in the United States, with the nodular type accounting for 80% of cases. Risk factors include fair skin and a history of heavy sun exposure.

Generally, when BCC is suspected a biopsy (eg, punch, shave, excisional) is done initially to conﬁrm the diagnosis and assess for high-risk histologic features. In an excisional biopsy, the entirety of the visible lesion is removed, usually without excising a margin of surrounding skin. If the biopsy conﬁrms BCC, additional excision with 4-mm margins is done with the goal of completely removing cancerous tissue, including microscopic tumor extensions surrounding the visible lesion. Excision with 4-mm margins is associated with a low risk of recurrence and is a common deﬁnitive treatment strategy for BCC.

A 1-month-old girl is brought to the ofﬁce due to a large birthmark on the right side of the face and scalp. The lesion has become raised and increasingly bright red. There is no bleeding or oozing. Vital signs and growth parameters are normal. The lesion is shown in the exhibit; examination is otherwise unremarkable. MRI of the head and echocardiography reveal no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this

patient?

Management of the hemangioma itself depends on size, location, and risk of functional impairment. In this case, this patient's periorbital hemangioma warrants oral beta-blocker therapy (eg, propranolol) due to risk of visual impairment. During the proliferative phase, rapid growth of hemangiomas located near the eye can lead to physical obstruction of sight causing strabismus and amblyopia or corneal pressure causing astigmatism. Propranolol acts by local vasoconstriction to limit further growth, promoting regression of the lesion.

• A. Laser therapy (37%).

• B. Local excision (1%)

• C. Oral propranolol (44%)

• D. Topical metronidazole (5%)

• E. Topical tretinoin (12%)

Large, segmental hemangiomas, such as this patient's, are also at increased risk of ulceration, scarring, and permanent disﬁguration without pharmacotherapy, and most patients respond to propranolol within months with nearly complete resolution of the hemangioma.

(Choice A) Pulsed dye laser therapy is ﬁrst-line management for port-wine stains, which present as ﬂat, red-purple patches that do not proliferate in infancy. Laser therapy is rarely used for hemangiomas unless they are ulcerated.

(Choice D) Topical metronidazole is used to treat rosacea, which presents in adults with localized facial (eg, nose/cheeks) erythema with or without pustules and papules. This patient's age and raised, bright red, unilateral plaques are inconsistent with rosacea.

(Choice E) Topical retinoids (eg, tretinoin) are used to treat adolescent acne vulgaris, which can present as papulopustular lesions. Neonatal acne may look like adolescent acne, but it presents in early infancy and typically requires no treatment. Moreover, localized, increasingly red, raised plaques are inconsistent with this diagnosis.

Educational objective:

Although most infantile hemangiomas require no treatment, propranolol should be given for those that increase risk of functional impairment (eg, periorbital) or ulceration/scarring (eg, large, segmental). Propranolol causes hemangioma regression by promoting local vasoconstriction.

A 67-year-old man comes to the office due to a "sore" on the right side of his face. The sore

has been growing slowly over the past year, and it bleeds and oozes at times. The patient recently retired from his job as a mail carrier and spent his entire career delivering mail outdoors. He is otherwise healthy and has a 30-pack-year history. Skin examination reveals a 1.5-cm lesion, as shown in the exhibit. Biopsy shows basal cell carcinoma. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

• Low-risk BCC includes most lesions <2 cm in size on the trunk or extremities, excluding the hands and feet.

• High-risk BCC includes lesions on the face, neck, hands, feet, or genitalia, especially those ≥1 cm; lesions ≥2 cm in any location; and lesions with an aggressive histology or poorly deﬁned borders.

• A. CT scan of the head and neck (3%)

B. Curettage and electrodesiccation (1%)

C. Mohs micrographic surgery (73%)

First-line treatment for high-risk BCC is Mohs micrographic surgery. This technique is characterized by sequential removal of thin skin layers with intraoperative microscopic margin inspection to ensure complete removal of the cancer. This procedure allows for the highest cure rate and maximal preservation of normal tissue, an ideal choice for treating nonmelanoma skin cancers of the face, where the recurrence risk is high and cosmesis is a concern.

• D. Standard surgical excision with 4-mm margins (19%).

• E. Topical chemotherapy with 5-ﬂuorouracil (2%)

Omitted

(Choice A) BCC can be locally invasive (eg, invade nearby bone, nerves) but rarely metastasizes. A staging CT scan is not typically needed.

(Choice B) Curettage and electrodesiccation destroy the cancer mechanically and electrically without histologic margin evaluation but have inferior cosmetic outcomes; this treatment is generally reserved for low-risk tumors in non-cosmetically sensitive areas (eg, trunk, extremities).

(Choice D) A standard elliptical excision with 4-mm margins is used primarily to treat low-risk cancers in non-cosmetically sensitive areas. It is typically not recommended for the face

because of the technical difficulties associated with certain locations (eg, periorbital/eyelid

areas, nasolabial folds) and because it leaves a large scar.

(Choice E) Monotherapy with topical 5-ﬂuorouracil is reserved for small (eg, <1 cm), low-risk

lesions when surgical removal is not an option.

Educational objective:

Mohs micrographic surgery is the ﬁrst-line treatment for nonmelanoma skin cancers that have a high risk for recurrence. It allows for the highest cure rate and maximal preservation of normal tissue, making it an ideal option for facial lesions.

noticed 4 weeks ago.The patient has no fever or chills. The lesions do not itch. She underwent a right mastectomy for breast cancer 7 years ago and was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. Since her treatment, the patient has had swelling of the right arm. Vital signs are normal. There is nonpitting edema of the right upper extremity. On the inner surface of the right upper arm is a red plaque with no distinct borders, studded with 3 purple papules. The right breast has a well-healed scar, and the left breast is normal. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

• • A. Lesion biopsy (60%)

This patient was treated for breast cancer 7 years ago and now has a rapidly progressive, purple skin lesion with indistinct borders, indicating likely angiosarcoma, a rare malignant tumor derived from vascular endothelial cells. Although risk of primary breast angiosarcoma is quite low, patients with breast cancer who undergo radiation therapy or axillary lymph node dissection (with subsequent chronic lymphedema) are at substantially increased risk of secondary angiosarcoma approximately 4-8 years after therapy.

• B. Oral antifungal therapy (2%)

C. Oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics (6%)

Secondary angiosarcoma typically presents with purpuric papulonodular lesions and red, bruise-like plaques on the breast, axilla, and/or upper arm. Because the tumor spreads within the vasculature, most lesions have indistinct borders.The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by biopsy. Secondary angiosarcoma is an aggressive tumor that readily metastasizes; however, early surgical resection can often be curative.

(Choice B) Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, a fungal infection most common in gardeners, often occurs on the arm. However, lesions are erythematous, ulcerated nodules that arise along the lymphatic channels over weeks. The presence of purple nodules on an erythematous plaque with indistinct borders in the area of lymphedema is much more consistent with angiosarcoma.

version

(Choice C) Chronic lymphedema increases risk of skin and soft tissue infection (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) due to loss of the cutaneous barrier from skin weeping. However, cellulitis typically causes rapidly progressive skin symptoms (eg, erythema, warmth, induration) over days, not weeks. A lesion present for 4 weeks makes bacterial skin infection unlikely. (Choice D) Secondary angiosarcoma is an aggressive tumor; biopsy should be performed as soon as possible so surgical intervention can be planned. Waiting would increase risk of death. (Choice E) Topical corticosteroid therapy is used to treat lichen planus, which presents with

purple, polygonal papules and plaques with distinct (not indistinct) borders. Furthermore,

lesions are intensely pruritic.

However, although the ABCDE criteria can assist in evaluation of superﬁcial spreading melanoma, they are less effective in identifying nodular or atypical melanomas. Nodular melanomas account for up to 30% of all melanomas but may not meet any of the ABCDE criteria until they are relatively advanced. To address this shortcoming, additional visual criteria should be considered in assessing risk of melanoma:

Answered correctly

• In a patient with multiple pigmented lesions, a lesion that is substantially different from the others (eg, shape, color) may represent melanoma ("ugly duckling sign"). The "ugly duckling sign" has a sensitivity of up to 90% for melanoma.

• Palpable nodularity often corresponds with vertical growth of a melanoma and increases metastatic risk. The Breslow depth (distance from the epidermal granular cell layer to the deepest visible melanoma cells) is the most important prognostic indicator in malignant melanoma.

• Benign pigmented lesions are usually asymptomatic; biopsy should be considered for moles that itch, bleed, or are associated with local sensory symptoms (eg, tingling).

This patient has hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a chronic occlusion folliculitis involving folliculopilosebaceous units. Mechanical friction in intertriginous areas and other factors (eg, nicotine) are thought to induce inﬂammation, leading to the formation of painful, inﬂamed nodules; subcutaneous abscesses; and scarring. Sinus tracts may form, intermittently draining seropurulent material, as in this patient. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The diagnosis of HS is based primarily on the typical location, appearance, and recurring course. Initial lesions are typically sterile but may later become colonized or infected with a broad range of bacteria; antibiotics are the preferred therapy for reducing the bacterial load and providing additional anti-inﬂammatory effects.

A 58-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to an ulcer on the sole of the right foot. The patient noticed the wound 4 weeks ago. He has no history of trauma to the area. The ulcer has failed to heal despite wound care with moisture-retentive dressings and pressure ofﬂoading with orthotic devices. The patient has had no right foot pain, redness, swelling, fever, or chills.He has a 10-year history of diabetes mellitus complicated by diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy. He also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 3-cm ulcer under the ﬁrst metatarsal head of the right foot; the wound has a clean base and no signiﬁcant discharge. There is no surrounding erythema or areas of ﬂuctuance or tenderness. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient's foot ulcer?

• A. Foot imaging for osteomyelitis (48%)

Explanation

Patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus who have poor glycemic control are at high risk for diabetic foot ulcers. Risk is greatest in those with concomitant diabetic neuropathy, which reduces pain sensation and identiﬁcation of ulcer, and peripheral vascular disease, which reduces immune recruitment and ulcer healing. Because diabetic foot ulcers are usually colonized by a wide range of organisms (eg, aerobic gram-positive cocci, enterococci, Pseudomonas, anaerobes), they are often complicated by adjacent soft tissue infection and/or underlying osteomyelitis.

Although these infections often occur simultaneously, osteomyelitis can arise without evidence of soft tissue infection due to neuropathy (diminished pain) and poor peripheral blood ﬂow (diminished erythema, warmth, and purulence). Therefore, foot imaging (eg, x-ray, MRI) is generally recommended for all diabetic foot ulcers that are:

• B. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (9%)

• deep (eg, exposed bone, positive probe-to-bone testing).

• C. Lower extremity angiography (18%)

• long-standing (eg, present >7-14 days).

• D. Vitamin C and zinc supplementation (4%).

• E. Wound dressing with a topical antibiotic (18%)

Omitted

• large (eg, ≥2 cm).

• associated with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein.

• associated with adjacent soft tissue infection.

(Choice B) Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy is sometimes used in patients with poorly healing diabetic foot ulcers, evaluation for underlying osteomyelitis must occur prior to treatment because antibiotics and debridement might be required.

Version

(Choice C) This patient with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia is at high risk for peripheral vascular disease (PVD), which can be evaluated by angiography. However, initial testing for PVD usually consists of noninvasive studies (eg, ankle-brachial index testing).

A 58-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to an ulcer on the sole of the right foot. The patient noticed the wound 4 weeks ago. He has no history of trauma to the area. The ulcer has failed to heal despite wound care with moisture-retentive dressings and pressure ofﬂoading with orthotic devices. The patient has had no right foot pain, redness, swelling, fever, or chills.He has a 10-year history of diabetes mellitus complicated by diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy. He also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 3-cm ulcer under the ﬁrst metatarsal head of the right foot; the wound has a clean base and no signiﬁcant discharge. There is no surrounding erythema or areas of ﬂuctuance or tenderness. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient's foot ulcer?

• A. Foot imaging for osteomyelitis (48%)

• deep (eg, exposed bone, positive probe-to-bone testing).

• long-standing (eg, present >7-14 days).

• large (eg, ≥2 cm).

• associated with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein.

• associated with adjacent soft tissue infection.

(Choice B) Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy is sometimes used in patients with poorly healing diabetic foot ulcers, evaluation for underlying osteomyelitis must occur prior to treatment because antibiotics and debridement might be required.

• D. Vitamin C and zinc supplementation (4%)

• E. Wound dressing with a topical antibiotic (18%)

peripheral vascular disease (PVD), which can be evaluated by angiography. However, initial testing for PVD usually consists of noninvasive studies (eg, ankle-brachial index testing). In addition, although this patient might eventually need angiography and possibly stents, evaluation for osteomyelitis is required ﬁrst.

(Choice D) Although a deﬁciency of vitamin C or zinc can impair wound healing, supplementation with these vitamins should not be considered prior to ruling out underlying bone infection.

(Choice E) Although wound dressings are an important component of the treatment of diabetic ulcers, topical antibiotics should not be administered until osteomyelitis is ruled out. The presence of osteomyelitis necessitates systemic, not topical, antibiotics.

A diabetic foot ulcer is a common complication of long-standing diabetes mellitus and is particularly common in patients with neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease.Deep, longstanding, or large ulcers require foot imaging (eg, x-ray, MRI) to assess for underlying osteomyelitis, even when no signs or symptoms of soft tissue infection are present. Ulcers associated with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein also require

imaging.

solution

Wet-to-dry dressings are commonly used for wounds that are infected, have just been freshly debrided, or have devitalized tissue or ﬁbrinous slough at the base. They are typically performed twice a day and involve placing gauze that has been moistened (typically with saline) onto the wound. As the gauze dries, it adheres to the wound bed and, when it is

removed, debrides devitalized tissue.

Once devitalized tissue is removed and the wound has healthy granulation tissue (as in this patient), wet-to-dry dressings should be discontinued, because they can nonselectively debride the delicate granulation tissue that serves as a base for epithelial migration (ie, reepithelization). Instead, nonadherent and moisture-retaining dressings should be used. Moist wounds heal faster than dry wounds because wound ﬂuid contains factors that promote wound healing (eg, platelet-derived growth factor, ﬁbroblast growth factor, matrix metalloproteases). In addition, a moist environment promotes reepithelization. Because of these beneﬁts, wounds should also not be left open to the air and allowed to dry out (Choice

C).

(Choice B) Dakin solution (0.25% bleach) may be used in wet-to-dry dressings to treat infected wounds (especially those with Pseudomonas). However, it is corrosive to healthy tissue and is contraindicated in this noninfected, healing wound with healthy granulation tissue.

(Choice D) Performing sharp debridement down to bleeding (ie, viable) tissue is helpful when a wound has extensive slough or necrotic tissue at its surface. In contrast, this wound has well-vascularized granulation tissue without slough or necrosis; debridement is not indicated.

2023

Version

Educational objective:

Wound dressings are an important element of the healing process. Wet-to-dry dressings are commonly used for wounds that are infected or have devitalized tissue or slough. Once

healthy granulation tissue appears, dressings are switched to nonadherent, moisture-retaining

dressings to promote healing and epithelialization.

Which of the following factors is most likely to have increased this patient's risk for developing her current condition?

V • A. Atrophy of intrinsic foot muscles (40%)

This patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus likely has multiple factors contributing to her plantar foot ulcer, including peripheral neuropathy. Classically a length-dependent axonopathy involving the feet, diabetic neuropathy affects sensory, autonomic, and motor nerve ﬁbers, leading to the following adverse effects:

• Sensory neuropathy exposes the tissues to increased trauma (eg, friction from shoes due to decreased pain sensation) and pressure (eg, stomping feet due to decreased proprioception), and causes unawareness of tissue injury that can delay treatment.

• Autonomic neuropathy causes loss of autonomic tone in the arteriolar and capillary circulation, leading to shunting of blood from the arterioles to the veins and decreased

tissue perfusion.

• B. Incompetence of venous valves (30%)

• C. Increased sweat production of glabrous skin (14%)

D. Lack of weight bearing on the foot (14%)

Omitted

40%0 Answered correctly

Correct answer

• Motor neuropathy can cause atrophy of the small intrinsic muscles of the feet, leading to unopposed action of the large lower leg muscles, and clawing of the toes with hyperextension at the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. As a result, pressure is redistributed to the metatarsal heads, increasing susceptibility to callus formation, skin breakdown, and ulcer formation.

Glycemic control (to slow neuropathy progression) and proper foot care (eg, regular inspection, moisturization, well-ﬁtting shoes) are essential for reducing the risk of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.

(Choice B) Venous valve incompetence contributes to venous stasis ulcers, which are commonly located near the ankles and accompanied by surrounding brawny skin discoloration from hemosiderin deposition. In contrast, this patient's ulcer is on the plantar foot, and the skin has no brawny discoloration.

(Choice C) Diabetic autonomic neuropathy leads to loss of sympathetic innervation to sweat glands. This results in decreased (not increased) sweating, which contributes to dry skin that is more susceptible to ﬁssuring.

This patient's skin ulcer is consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). PG is a form of neutrophilic dermatosis that starts as an inﬂammatory papule, pustule, or nodule and progresses to form an expanding ulcer with a purulent or ﬁbrinous base and an irregular, violaceous border. PG can present as a single or as multiple lesions, usually on the trunk or lower extremities. Nearly 30% are triggered by local trauma (ie, pathergy).

version

The risk of PG is increased in patients who have an underlying systemic inﬂammatory disorder. Common associations include inﬂammatory bowel disease, autoimmune arthropathies (eg, rheumatoid arthritis), and hematologic conditions (eg, acute myeloid

leukemia).

PG is diagnosed clinically after excluding other diagnoses (eg, infection, cutaneous cancers).

Biopsy of the ulcer margin is recommended and typically shows a mixed cellular inﬁltrate with dermal and epidermal necrosis. Surgical debridement is usually avoided due to the potential of inducing pathergy; most lesions respond to treatment with local or systemic glucocorticoids.

A 59-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce with a 3-month history of persistent right ear pain. He has tried to control the pain with acetaminophen and ibuprofen but with no improvement. He has no other medical issues. He works as a welder and has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years and drinks a case of beer each weekend. Vital signs are within normal limits. Right ear examination shows a normal external ear, normal external auditory canal, and a clear tympanic membrane with no middle ear ﬂuid. Palpation of the temporomandibular joint elicits no tenderness or crepitus. His left ear examination shows no abnormalities. Oral cavity examination shows poor dentition, but there are no ulcers. The tonsils are not enlarged, and posterior pharyngeal wall is nonerythematous. There is a nontender 2-cm lymph node on the right side of his neck.

Otalgia in the setting of a normal ear examination is likely referred pain (pain perceived at a different site than its true origin).The most common causes of referred otalgia are dental disease and temporomandibular joint disorders. However, referred otalgia is commonly a presenting symptom of mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), especially in an older patient with a history of smoking, alcohol use, occupational exposure to welding fumes, and cervical lymphadenopathy.

Referred pain frequently occurs when nerves travel in close proximity, especially if their cell bodies are located in the same ganglia or they synapse in the same location. In this case, the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), which has afferent ﬁbers innervating the base of the tongue, also has a branch that provides afferent sensory input from the external auditory canal; all of these afferent ﬁbers converge in a ganglion just prior to entering the jugular foramen. Similarly, the vagus nerve (CN X), which innervates parts of the larynx and hypopharynx, also provides sensory innervation to the external auditory canal.

• A. Audiogram (6%)

B. Flexible laryngopharyngoscopy (51%)

C. MR imaging of the brain (30%)

D. Reassurance and symptomatic care (6%)

E. Tympanometry (5%)

Therefore, referred otalgia can be due to a tumor at the base of the tongue or from the larynx/hypopharynx. Flexible laryngopharyngoscopy would likely identify the primary tumor site.

(Choice A) An audiogram is used to evaluate hearing loss. Although many etiologies of hearing loss present with a normal ear examination, ear pain, especially in a patient with HNSCC risk factors, is concerning for malignancy.

• F. Tympanostomy tube placement (0%)

(Choice C) MRI scan of the brain can assess for vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma), which can cause hearing loss, dizziness, and tinnitus but would not cause referred otalgia. Referred otalgia is almost never due to central causes.

(Choices E and F) Tympanometry can assess for eustachian tube dysfunction, which can cause ear pain but would also cause hearing loss, feeling of fullness, and tympanic membrane retraction or middle ear effusion; tympanostomy tube placement can be considered in patients who do not respond to medical management (eg, decongestants). Tube placement is also indicated in some children with recurrent otitis media.

A 40-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce for evaluation of recurrent epistaxis. Every morning, the patient wakes up with signiﬁcant nasal congestion; when he blows his nose, he often sees crusting and blood clots in the tissue. Afterward, his nose frequently (several times a week) starts bleeding. It stops with <5 minutes of pinching his nasal alae. Medical history includes obesity, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Vital signs are within normal limits.On examination, the nose has bilateral crusting with excoriations on both sides of the nasal septum, but there is no bleeding. Which of the following is the most appropriate step in management of this

patient's condition?

Explanation

This patient's nasal crusting and recurrent epistaxis are likely related to his use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). After beginning CPAP, many patients develop new nasal symptoms, including dryness, obstruction, and epistaxis due to mucosal damage caused by the cold, dry, pressurized air. On examination, the nasal mucosa appears dry and erythematous with signiﬁcant crusting.

Nasal symptoms often improve signiﬁcantly with warming and humidiﬁcation of the air

B. Complete blood count and coagulation panel (9%)

C. CPAP humidiﬁcation (81%)

D. Nasal corticosteroid sprays (4%)

through the CPAP machine. Nasal saline irrigation is recommended to moisturize the nasal mucosa and assist with clearing of dry secretions. Patients may also apply a lubricating jelly (eg, saline gel, petroleum) to the anterior septum. However, improvement in nasal symptoms does not appear to increase compliance with CPAP therapy.

Time Spent

(Choice A) Excoriations and crusting sometimes represent malignancy, which can present with recurrent epistaxis and may require biopsy for diagnosis. This patient has no focal lesion, and exposure to dry air from the use of CPAP is a much more likely reason for his symptoms. (Choice B) A complete blood count is ordered in cases of severe epistaxis that may require transfusion, but that is not needed in this patient. Coagulation studies are required in patients who are receiving anticoagulation medication or who have recurrent, spontaneous epistaxis. This patient has an obvious cause of epistaxis (CPAP).

Version

(Choice D) Although corticosteroid nasal sprays are effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, they have no effect on nasal symptoms induced by CPAP use. In addition, corticosteroids may cause thinning, dryness, and/or damage of the nasal septum, further contributing to epistaxis.

(Choice E) For the treatment of acute epistaxis, nostril pinching is the ﬁrst step in management. Oxymetazoline (a topical vasoconstrictor) can be applied if direct compression alone is not effective. However, oxymetazoline is not useful for prevention and should not be used for more than 3 days due to the risk of rebound congestion (ie, rhinitis medicamentosa).

A 4-month-old boy is brought to the ofﬁce for "noisy breathing." The patient's parents ﬁrst noticed a harsh sound when he cried at age 2 weeks, but it has gotten louder over the past month, especially when he is lying on his back. The noise seems to improve when the patient is held upright or during "tummy time." He does not appear to have labored breathing and has never turned blue. The patient has had occasional, small spit-ups after feeds but has been growing well along the 60th percentile for weight. He was born at full term without complications during pregnancy or labor and delivery. On physical examination, the patient has inspiratory stridor when he is supine that improves when he is prone. The remainder of the examination is normal. Which of the following would conﬁrm the most likely diagnosis for this patient?

Explanation

Laryngomalacia

Pathophysiology • Collapse of supraglottic tissues on inspiration

Clinical • Inspiratory stridor that worsens when supine presentation • Peak at age 4-8 months Diagnosis • Laryngoscopy (eg, omega-shaped [Q] epiglottis)

• A. Chest radiography (1%)

B. CT scan of the neck (3%)

• Reassurance with close follow-up (# concurrent GER Management treatment) for most cases

• Supraglottoplasty for severe symptoms

GER = gastroesophageal reﬂux.

C. Flexible ﬁberoptic laryngoscopy (77%)

D. Fluoroscopic barium swallow (2%)

• E. MR angiography of the neck (4%)

• F. Plain radiograph of the neck (10%)

Laryngomalacia, which causes chronic stridor in infants, is typiﬁed by "ﬂoppy" supraglottic structures that collapse during inspiration. Proposed pathophysiologic etiologies include laryngeal hypotonia (due to delayed maturation or neuromuscular disorder), redundant supraglottic soft tissue, and inﬂammation (due to reﬂux).

Stridor from laryngomalacia usually begins in the neonatal period and is loudest at age 4-8

months. Presentation includes inspiratory stridor that is worse in the supine position and

exacerbated by feeding or upper respiratory illnesses; prone positioning improves symptoms. The diagnosis is conﬁrmed with visualization of the larynx, typically by ﬂexible ﬁberoptic laryngoscopy. Findings include an omega-shaped (Q) epiglottis and collapse of the supraglottic structures during inspiration.

version

Gastroesophageal reﬂux (GER) treatment often improves symptoms; it is unclear whether GER causes laryngomalacia or is due to a common underlying mechanism (eg, neuromuscular disorder). Most infants with laryngomalacia will feed, grow, and ventilate normally with

spontaneous resolution of stridor by age 18 months. Infants with feeding difﬁculties, tachypnea, cyanosis, or failure to thrive may require surgery to remove redundant supraglottic

tissues.

C. Flexible ﬁberoptic laryngoscopy (77%)

D. Fluoroscopic barium swallow (2%)

(Choice A) Chest radiographs can identify anterior mediastinal masses and radiopaque foreign bodies, both of which can cause stridor. Mediastinal masses (eg, lymphoma) also present with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy), and airway foreign bodies present with a more acute symptom onset; these symptoms are not seen in this patient. (Choices B and F) Retropharyngeal abscesses occur in toddlers and present with fever, dysphagia, neck pain, and stridor. Lateral neck radiographs can demonstrate thickening of the prevertebral space. CT scan of the neck can better deﬁne extension of the abscess to nearby structures. This patient does not have symptoms suggestive of infection.

• E. MR angiography of the neck (4%)

• F. Plain radiograph of the neck (10%)

(Choices D and E) Vascular rings occur when an anomalous branch of the aortic arch or pulmonary artery encircles the trachea and esophagus. They may cause biphasic or expiratory stridor due to tracheal compression and feeding difﬁculties due to esophageal compression. A barium swallow can identify indentations of the esophagus, and the diagnosis can be conﬁrmed with contrasted CT scan or MR angiography.

A 53-year-old woman is evaluated in the postanesthesia care unit following thyroid surgery.

Explanation

She underwent a total thyroidectomy for a retrosternal goiter that was causing dysphagia from esophageal compression. The patient states her neck feels a little "tight" but has no signiﬁcant pain or difﬁculty breathing. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 126/86 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears comfortable, with no distress. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive. Voice is normal. Neck incision is well-approximated, and there is a 4-cm ballotable swelling under the incision. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart sounds are normal. The neck swelling increases in size during the examination. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

This patient with an enlarging ﬂuid collection (ballotable neck swelling) developing after thyroidectomy likely has an expanding neck hematoma. An expanding neck hematoma is life-threatening due to the potential for airway obstruction, either from direct airway compression or from vascular compression causing venous congestion leading to laryngeal edema. Stridor, dysphagia, voice changes, and "tripod positioning" are all signs of increasing upper airway obstruction; however, patients can initially have few or no symptoms (as in this patient with only mild neck tightness). Notably, patients often maintain their peripheral blood oxygenation concentration until rapid (<1 min) decompensation.

• A. Compressive dressing application (12%)

• B. CT scan of the neck with contrast (10%)

• C. Fluoroscopic swallowing study (3%)

• D. Immediate wound exploration (64%)

• E. Urgent cricothyrotomy (8%).

Omitted

64%

Correct answer

Answered correctly

The most important step in management is to decompress the airway by immediately evacuating the hematoma (including at the bedside if necessary). This is done by reopening the incision and removing the blood collection. The wound should then be explored in the operating room to control the source of bleeding, and the patient's airway should be evaluated to assess for laryngeal edema and need for protective endotracheal intubation (until the edema subsides).

(Choice A) Compression via direct pressure or with a compressive dressing is often used to control bleeding at many sites. However, when bleeding is in the neck, compression can worsen the airway obstruction.

02 secs

Time Spent

(Choice B) A CT scan of the neck is not needed to diagnose an expanding neck hematoma and would delay potentially life-saving treatment.

2023

(Choice C) A ﬂuoroscopic swallowing study may be used to assess for pharyngeal or esophageal injury (which would not cause rapidly expanding neck swelling) or to evaluate swallowing function if there is concern that a regular diet may be unsafe (eg, in some patients with head and neck tumors).

(Choice E) Urgent cricothyrotomy involves an incision through the cricothyroid membrane to secure an airway for a patient in distress when other forms of airway management are unsuccessful, unavailable, or contraindicated. This patient's airway is threatened by a hematoma; removal may be sufﬁcient to improve the airway.

©UWorld This patient has nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which is associated with the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Tumors typically express EBV DNA, and EBV assays are often used to monitor treatment response and disease relapse. NPC is rare in the United States but is endemic to southern China (and parts of Africa and the Middle East). Risk is thought to be higher in these locations due to diet (salt-cured food, early exposure to salted ﬁsh) and genetic predisposition.

NPC tumors obstruct the nasopharynx and invade adjacent tissues, often resulting in nasal congestion with epistaxis, headache, cranial nerve palsies (eg, facial numbness), and/or serous otitis media (eustachian tube obstruction). Early metastatic spread to the cervical lymph nodes may cause a nontender neck mass (as in this patient).

• A. Aﬂatoxin B , exposure (15%)

(Choice A) Aﬂatoxin B, is a mycotoxin that often contaminates agricultural products and is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, not NPC.

B. Epstein-Barr virus infection (76%)

C. Excessive use of nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (1%)

D. Recurrent bacterial sinusitis (7%)

E. Vitamin A supplements (0%)

(Choice C) Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often associated with bleeding (gastrointestinal) and renal injury. Although NSAIDs may increase the risk of epistaxis, they are not a cause of NPC.

(Choice D) Recurrent bacterial sinusitis may result in nasal polyposis. This may manifest with nasal congestion and thick rhinorrhea. Recurrent sinusitis is not typically associated with NPC.

Omitted

(Choice E) Some forms of vitamin A (eg, beta carotene) in excess may increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers, but there is no association with NPC.

A 22-year-old man comes to the urgent care clinic after being hit in the face with a

basketball. He had bleeding from both sides of his nose for about 10 minutes that stopped with pressure. He is currently unable to breathe through his nose. Medical history is signiﬁcant for allergic rhinitis treated with oral antihistamines. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On examination, there is bruising across the nose and under the eyes. Anterior rhinoscopy reveals no bleeding. There is soft, ﬂuctuant swelling of the septum bilaterally. There is no blood in the oropharynx. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

A. Apply ice packs to the nose and recommend NSAIDs (38%)

This patient who sustained nasal trauma and now has nasal obstruction and ﬂuctuant swelling of the nasal septum has a septal hematoma, which is an accumulation of blood between the perichondrium and the septal cartilage.

Although the incidence is rare, the complications of an untreated septal hematoma are signiﬁcant. Infection can develop rapidly (2-3 days) and lead to a septal abscess. In addition, because the septal cartilage has no direct blood supply and receives all nutrients via diffusion from the perichondrium, a septal hematoma can cause avascular necrosis of the septal cartilage. Destruction of the nasal septal cartilage can result in septal perforations, external nasal deformities (eg, saddle nose), or internal nasal valve collapse (ie, nasal obstruction).

B. Embolize the sphenopalatine artery (6%)

C. Incise and drain the nasal septum (43%)

D. Insert anterior nasal packing (6%)

Therefore, all patients who sustain nasal trauma undergo examination of the nasal septum. Palpation can differentiate between a deviated nasal septum (ﬁrm) and a septal hematoma (soft, ﬂuctuant). Patients with a septal hematoma require prompt incision and drainage. After incision and drainage, anterior nasal packing should be placed to compress the perichondrium to the nasal septum; ice packs and NSAIDs can reduce edema due to inﬂammation (Choices A and D). Patients are treated with antibiotics and require otolaryngology evaluation after a few days for packing removal and assessment.

• E. Order a complete blood count and coagulation studies (4%)

Omitted

Correct answer

(Choice B) Embolization of the sphenopalatine artery is one method to control posterior epistaxis. This patient does not currently have epistaxis because blood has already accumulated in the nasal septum.

43%

01 sec

Answered correctly

lime spent

(Choice E) A complete blood count is ordered in cases of severe epistaxis that may require transfusion, but it is not needed in this patient who has had no further bleeding. Coagulation studies are ordered in patients who are anticoagulated or have recurrent, spontaneous epistaxis. This patient is healthy and has an obvious cause of epistaxis (trauma).

Version

Educational objective:

A septal hematoma presents after nasal trauma as ﬂuctuant swelling of the nasal septum. It should be recognized and promptly drained to avoid complications of infection, septal perforation, and nasal deformities.

The neck is stiff with reduced passive range of motion. Lung auscultation is normal. Lateral radiographs of the neck reveal increased thickness of the prevertebral soft tissues with an air-ﬂuid level. Because of potential contiguous spread of the disease, this patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following?

• A. Acute necrotizing mediastinitis (49%)

This patient has a retropharyngeal abscess with neck pain, odynophagia, and fever following penetrating trauma to the posterior pharynx. Examination ﬁndings can include neck stiffness and bulging of the pharyngeal wall. Such deep space infections of the neck can progress rapidly to surrounding structures, with potentially fatal complications. Behind the posterior pharyngeal wall lies the retropharyngeal space, a deep compartment of the neck deﬁned anteriorly by the buccopharyngeal fascia and constrictor muscles of the pharynx and posteriorly by the alar fascia; it communicates laterally with the parapharyngeal space.

Infection within the retropharyngeal space can extend posteriorly through the alar fascia into the "danger" space (between the alar and prevertebral fasciae), which can rapidly transmit infection into the posterior mediastinum. Acute necrotizing mediastinitis, a life-threatening complication characterized by fever, chest pain, dyspnea, and odynophagia, requires urgent surgical Intervention. Therefore, all patients diagnosed with retropharyngeal abscess need chest x-ray (anteroposterior and lateral views) to look for widened mediastinum.

• B. Cranial subdural empyema (2%)

C. Ludwig angina (13%)

Infection within the retropharyngeal space can also extend into the superior mediastinum, with spread to the carotid sheath potentially resulting in thrombosis of the internal jugular vein and deﬁcits in cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII.

• D. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (5%).

• E. Spinal epidural abscess (28%)

(Choice B) Extension of infection from the paranasal sinuses through the underlying bone can lead to subdural empyema. Clinical ﬁndings include fever, headache, and mass effect signs (eg, altered mental status).

(Choice C) Ludwig angina is a rapidly progressive cellulitis of the bilateral submandibular and sublingual spaces, most often arising from an infected mandibular molar. Clinical ﬁndings include fever, dysphagia, odynophagia, and drooling.

Version

(Choice D) Cavernous sinus thrombosis is most often due to the contiguous spread of infection from the middle third of the face, sinuses, or teeth via the valveless facial venous system. Clinical ﬁndings include headache, fever, cranial nerve deﬁcits (eg, diplopia), and

proptosis.

(Choice E) Spinal epidural abscess can be caused by hematogenous dissemination (eg, intravenous drug use), contiguous spread from vertebral osteomyelitis, or direct inoculation (eg, epidural anesthesia). Symptoms include fever, focal back pain, and neurologic deﬁcits.

Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F), blood pressure is 126/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 106/min. Examination shows pooling of saliva in the hypopharynx. The posterior pharyngeal wall is red and bulging. The neck is stiff with reduced passive range of motion. Lung auscultation is normal. Lateral radiographs of the neck reveal increased thickness of the prevertebral soft tissues with an air-ﬂuid level. Because of potential contiguous spread of the disease, this patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following?

• A. Acute necrotizing mediastinitis (49%)

Infection within the retropharyngeal space can extend posteriorly through the alar fascia into the "danger" space (between the alar and prevertebral fasciae), which can rapidly transmit infection into the posterior mediastinum. Acute necrotizing mediastinitis, a life-threatening complication characterized by fever, chest pain, dyspnea, and odynophagia, requires urgent surgical intervention. Therefore, all patients diagnosed with retropharyngeal abscess need chest x-ray (anteroposterior and lateral views) to look for widened mediastinum.

Infection within the retropharyngeal space can also extend into the superior mediastinum, with spread to the carotid sheath potentially resulting in thrombosis of the internal jugular vein and deﬁcits in cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII.

(Choice B) Extension of infection from the paranasal sinuses through the underlying bone can lead to subdural empyema. Clinical ﬁndings include fever, headache, and mass effect signs (eg, altered mental status).

• B. Cranial subdural empyema (2%)

(Choice C) Ludwig angina is a rapidly progressive cellulitis of the bilateral submandibular and sublingual spaces, most often arising from an infected mandibular molar. Clinical ﬁndings include fever, dysphagia, odynophagia, and drooling.

C. Ludwig angina (13%)

• D. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (5%).

• E. Spinal epidural abscess (28%)

(Choice D) Cavernous sinus thrombosis is most often due to the contiguous spread of infection from the middle third of the face, sinuses, or teeth via the valveless facial venous system. Clinical ﬁndings include headache, fever, cranial nerve deﬁcits (eg, diplopia), and

proptosis.

A 34-year-old man comes to the office due to intermittent dizziness over the past 3 months.

Explanation

The patient has had episodes of a sudden spinning sensation, accompanied by nausea, that

resolve spontaneously after approximately a minute. Symptoms occur when he is lifting heavy weights, riding on an elevator, or after sneezing. He has had no headache or ear pain but has trouble hearing out of the right ear. The patient had a concussion after a bicycle collision 4 months ago but has no other medical conditions and has had no recent upper respiratory illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows normal ears, including tympanic membranes. There is no extremity weakness or sensory loss. No nystagmus is present at rest but performing a Valsalva maneuver provokes nystagmus and the other reported symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

The inner ear contains the endolymphatic ﬂuid-ﬁlled semicircular canals (which convey movement and position of the head) and the cochlea (which is the sensory organ of hearing). Conditions that cause disruption of endolymph ﬂow can present with vertigo (semicircular canals) and/or sensorineural hearing loss (cochlea).

Perilymphatic ﬁstulas are a rare, but debilitating, complication of head injury or barotrauma. They cause leakage of endolymph from the semicircular canals and cochlea into surrounding tissues, resulting in characteristic clinical features:

• Progressive sensorineural hearing loss caused by damage to cochlear hair cells from

• A. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (20%) B. Eustachian tube dysfunction (20%)

loss of endolymph.

C. Ménière disease (19%)

D. Orthostatic hypotension (2%)

• Episodic vertigo with nystagmus triggered by pressure changes in the inner ear (eg, Valsalva maneuver, elevation changes [eg, riding in elevator]) due to acutely increased endolymph leakage. This can be demonstrated clinically by performing a loud clap (ie, pressure change due to sound conduction through the ossicles) near the patient's ear and observing for nystagmus (Tullio phenomenon).

• E. Perilymphatic ﬁstula (25%)

• F. Postconcussive syndrome (11%).

Patients are advised to limit activities that increase inner ear pressure; they also require ENT referral for further management.

(Choice A) Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is caused by debris (otoliths) that temporarily alters endolymph ﬂow through the semicircular canals. Therefore, patients typically have sudden, brief (<1-min) episodes of vertigo triggered by head movement.

version

(Choice B) Eustachian tube dysfunction can result in ﬂuid in the middle ear space (not the inner ear vestibular system) and can cause ear popping, cracking, and hearing loss in response to changes in pressure. However, it also causes a sense of ear fullness or pain, not episodic vertigo with nystagmus.

(Choice C) Ménière disease is caused by increased endolymphatic ﬂuid volume or pressure in the vestibular system. It also causes episodic vertigo with hearing loss, but episodes are accompanied by aural fullness or tinnitus, last 20 minutes to 24 hours, and often lack speciﬁc, identiﬁable triggers.

In this patient with low risk for malignancy (ie, light alcohol intake; minimal, remote smoking history), the symmetric, nontender lesions that occur bilaterally on the lingual sides of the mandible are consistent with mandibular tori, which are benign bony growths (exostoses) that protrude from the mandible. Mandibular tori are more common than palatal tori, which present as midline, symmetric, bony lesions on the hard palate.

This patient who sustained trauma to the ear has an auricular hematoma, which is a collection of blood between the perichondrium and cartilage of the outer ear. Athletes who participate in contact sports, such as wrestling or martial arts, are at highest risk of ear injury. Physical examination is diagnostic with a swollen, erythematous, tender area of ﬂuctuance at the site of the hematoma.

version

The complications of an untreated auricular hematoma are signiﬁcant. Infection can develop rapidly (2-3 days) and lead to an abscess. In addition, because the auricular cartilage has no direct blood supply and receives all nutrients via diffusion from the perichondrium, an auricular hematoma can cause avascular necrosis of the outer ear cartilage.Subsequent ﬁbrocartilage overgrowth can lead to a permanent deformity known as cauliﬂower ear.

Therefore, management includes prompt aspiration or incision and drainage of the blood collection with application of a pressure dressing to prevent reaccumulation of the hematoma. Patients are treated with oral antibiotics that include coverage for skin ﬂora and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Daily follow-up for 3-5 days is recommended to assess healing and evaluate for signs of infection (eg, fever, purulent drainage) or blood reaccumulation.

A 43-year-old man is found wandering in the street in winter and is brought to the emergency department by a passing motorist. The patient is confused and unable to provide any history. He has no previous hospital records.On examination, there is mild hypothermia (temperature 35 C [95 F]), but vital signs are otherwise normal. The patient appears lethargic but tollows commanas. Ine oral mucosa Is moist, and there are extensive dental caries. The patient has no cervical lymphadenopathy, but there is bilateral, nontender swelling of the cheeks consistent with salivary gland enlargement. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this latter ﬁnding?

V ( • A. Chronic alcohol use (60%)

Explanation

This patient has nontender, bilateral enlargement of the parotid glands, which is consistent with sialadenosis. Sialadenosis is a benign, noninﬂammatory swelling of the salivary glands. It can result from overaccumulation of secretory granules in acinar cells (possibly due to abnormal autonomic innervation) in patients with chronic alcohol use, bulimia, or malnutrition. It can also result from fatty inﬁltration of the glands in patients with diabetes mellitus or liver disease.

B. Mumps (7%)

C. Pleomorphic adenoma (6%)

D. Salivary gland stone (7%)

Sialadenosis presents with gradual enlargement of the glands that does not ﬂuctuate and is not associated with eating. Recognition of this condition should prompt an investigation for underlying disease. Control of the underlying disease may improve (but usually not fully resolve) the glandular enlargement.

• E. Sjögren syndrome (6%).

• F. Vitamin A deﬁciency (11%)

(Choice B) Parotitis due to mumps can present with parotid swelling.However, it is typically painful and presents a few days after the onset of systemic symptoms (eg, fever, headache, myalgias).

(Choice C) A pleomorphic adenoma is a benign salivary neoplasm that can present with painless enlargement of the parotid gland. However, the enlargement would be unilateral, and a distinct mass is typically palpated.

(Choice D) Salivary stones (sialolithiasis) can block the ﬂow of saliva out of the duct and lead to swelling due to increased ﬂuid in the gland. However, swelling due to sialolithiasis is usually ﬂuctuating, painful, and associated with eating (which stimulates saliva secretion).

Version

(Choice E) Sjögren syndrome can lead to bilateral swelling of the parotid glands due to lymphocytic inﬁltration. However, in contrast to this patient, it typically presents in women and is associated with dry mouth on examination (whereas this patient's mucous membranes are

moist).

(Choice F) Vitamin A deﬁciency often coexists with malnutrition, which can lead to sialadenosis. However, sialadenosis in these patients is probably related to protein malnutrition rather than vitamin A deﬁciency. Vitamin A deﬁciency most notably causes ocular manifestations, including impaired night vision, dry eyes, and keratinization of the conjunctivae

and corneas.

However, sialadenosis in these patients is probably related to protein malnutrition rather than vitamin A deﬁciency. Vitamin A deﬁciency most notably causes ocular manifestations, including impaired night vision, dry eyes, and keratinization of the conjunctivae

and corneas.

A 66-year-old man comes to the office due to a sore throat over the last 3 months. The pain

Explanation

in the throat is worsening and is particularly noticeable when the patient swallows. He thought the pain was related to tonsil stones and tried picking them out with toothpicks and gargling with salt water after meals, but this did not relieve the pain. The patient has noticed an ulcer on the right tonsil that bleeds when he touches it. Medical history is signiﬁcant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for which he uses multiple inhalers. The patient has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Ear examination is normal. The nasal mucosa is dry, and examination of the oral cavity shows poor dentition with no lesions. Oropharyngeal examination shows an enlarged, ﬁrm right tonsil with a 1-cm ulceration with surrounding ﬁbrinous debris. The left tonsil has several small tonsil stones without surrounding inﬂammation. There is no cervical adenopathy. Biopsy of this lesion would most likely reveal which of the following?

An ulcerated tonsillar lesion in a patient with a long smoking history is highly suspicious for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Oropharyngeal SCC may present with sore throat and odynophagia due to tumor invasion or local irritation. Lesions often ulcerate and can be friable (eg, bleeding to light touch). Other manifestations include referred otalgia or an isolated neck mass (representing regional nodal spread of disease).

A. Adenocarcinoma (6%)

• B. Aphthous ulcer (5%)

• C. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1%)

• D. Pemphigus vulgaris (0%).

• E. Small cell carcinoma (0%)

v • F. Squamous cell carcinoma (85%)

Omitted

Traditional risk factors for oropharyngeal SCC include age >40, tobacco use, alcohol use, and immunocompromised status. There has also been a dramatic increase in oropharyngeal cancer due to human papillomavirus (HPV), which may be seen in younger, nonsmoking patients. This patient should undergo biopsy of the tonsil lesion with evaluation of HPV status as well as neck imaging (eg, CT scan) to characterize the lesion and any associated nodal metastasis.

Tonsil stones (tonsilloliths)-commonly occurring concretions of food, cellular, and bacterial debris-are not known to be risk factors for oropharyngeal SCC and can be managed with gentle removal (eg, gargling with salt water). However, frequent patient manipulation (eg, with toothpicks) can cause mucosal trauma, which may be mistaken as an ulcerated neoplasm.

(Choice A) A tonsil malignancy is unlikely to be adenocarcinoma. Lung adenocarcinoma shares some risk factors (eg, smoking, age) and possible presenting symptoms (eg, cough, hemoptysis) with oropharyngeal SCC, but it does not metastasize to the tonsil.

Thyroglobulin (Tg) is the precursor to active thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and is produced by normal thyroid tissue or differentiated (ie, papillary, follicular) thyroid cancer. Most Tg is stored in the thyroid gland, but some is released into the circulation. Patients such as this one who have undergone a total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine treatment should have no residual normal thyroid tissue; therefore, a rising Tg level in these patients is likely due to recurrent

differentiated thyroid cancer.

Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical incision with no palpable neck masses or enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Laboratory testing shows signiﬁcantly elevated serum thyroglobulin concentration compared with the previous level 6 months ago. Which of the following best explains the observed laboratory ﬁnding in this patient?

Patients who have undergone thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer require levothyroxine (T4) supplementation for 2 reasons:

• Levothyroxine replaces thyroid gland function.

• Levothyroxine suppresses pituitary release of TSH (negative feedback). Because TSH stimulates thyroid tissue growth, levothyroxine supplementation to suppress TSH (ie, by causing a mildly hyperthyroid state) may help prevent thyroid cancer recurrence.

A. Adverse effect of radioactive iodine treatment (14%)

B. Antibody formation against tumor neoantigens (3%)

C. Enhanced negative feedback to the pituitary (18%)

D. Excessive thyroid hormone replacement (23%)

E. Recurrence of the thyroid malignancy (40%)

In some patients, a "stimulated" Tg level can also be obtained to evaluate for recurrence. This test measures the Tg level after withdrawing levothyroxine supplementation (to increase pituitary release of TSH) or after giving recombinant TSH. If there is recurrent cancer, the increased TSH will cause increased Tg release from the cancer cells.

(Choice A) Radioactive iodine causes radiation-induced destruction of thyroid cells and is used as an adjuvant treatment for thyroid cancer. Because the iodine can be taken up by other cells, adverse effects include sialadenitis (salivary gland infection), dry mouth, and pulmonary ﬁbrosis. Tg levels would not be affected.

(Choice B) Tumor neoantigens are attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. However,

increased immunologic response (ie, increased antibody formation) toward tumor cells should decrease persistent/recurrent disease and therefore decrease serum Tg.

Version

(Choices C and D) Excess thyroid hormone replacement, which leads to enhanced negative feedback to the pituitary, would be expected to decrease, rather than increase, Tg levels in patients who have Tg-producing cells (including in this patient with likely recurrent thyroid cancer).

Educational objective:

Thyroglobulin is produced only by thyroid tissue (either normally functioning or malignant). Serum thyroglobulin measurements are used as a tumor marker once the normally functioning thyroid tissue is removed.

After several days of a bilateral sore throat, this patient has developed dysphagia, fever, and unilateral worsening of throat pain. Clinical examination shows a mufﬂed voice, trismus, unilateral swelling of the soft palate, and uvular deviation, ﬁndings consistent with peritonsillar abscess (PTA).

A PTA is an acute bacterial infection of the region between the tonsil and the pharyngeal muscies. It begins as persistent tonsillitis/pharyngitis and progresses to cellulitis/phlegmon, with pus collecting into an abscess within a week of symptom onset. The abscess collection in the soft tissue of the palate leads to a visible bulge above the tonsil that pushes the uvula to the contralateral side. It also decreases the space in the posterior pharynx, leading to decreased voice resonance and resulting in the classic mufﬂed, or "hot potato," voice.

Clinical history and examination are typically sufﬁcient for diagnosing and treating a PTA. Treatment involves needle aspiration or incision and drainage of the abscess plus antibiotic therapy to cover group A hemolytic Streptococcus and respiratory anaerobes. If a PTA is not diagnosed and treated promptly, it can be fatal secondary to either airway obstruction or spread of the infection into the parapharyngeal space, which may lead to involvement of the carotid sheath (Choice E).

A 40-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce for evaluation of a sore throat. It began 2 months ago, worsens with swallowing, and is making it difﬁcult for her to swallow solid foods. She has also noticed worsening bad breath. Medical history is unremarkable. She has never smoked and uses alcohol rarely. The patient is currently in a long-term monogamous relationship and has had multiple sexual partners over her lifetime. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, and pulse is 82/min. Ear examination reveals a clear external ear canal with an intact tympanic membrane with no middle ear ﬂuid. The nasal mucosa is pink with no nasal drainage. Oral cavity examination shows mild dental disease but no mucosal lesions. Oropharyngeal examination reveals an enlarged, ﬁrm right tonsil with a 2-cm ulceration. There are also 2 enlarged, ﬁrm, ﬁxed, nontender lymph nodes in the right side of her neck. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this

patient's condition?

Explanation

This patient's persistent, enlarged, ﬁrm neck mass and ulcerated tonsillar lesion are consistent with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which can also lead to pharyngitis, dysphagia, and halitosis (bad breath). Traditional risk factors for HNSCC include older age, tobacco and alcohol exposure, and poor dentition. With the decrease in smoking rates, there has been a decline in many types of HNSCC; however, the incidence of oropharyngeal (eg, tonsil, base of tongue) HNSCC has dramatically increased.

• A. Actinomyces israelii (17%)

• B. Epstein-Barr virus (15%)

This increase is due to human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive HNSCC, often seen in younger patients with no tobacco exposure and multiple sexual partners (as in this patient). HPVpositive HNSCC primarily affects the oropharynx (possibly due to the higher concentration of lymphatic tissue facilitating viral processing) and often presents with neck lymphadenopathy. However, it is more responsive to therapy than HPV-negative HNSCC. The most common causative subtype is HPV-16, which is covered by the HPV vaccine.

C. Fusobacterium necrophorum (24%)

D. Human papillomavirus (30%)

This patient should undergo biopsy of the tonsil lesion with evaluation of HPV status, neck imaging (eg, CT scan) to characterize the lesion and associated nodal metastasis, and endoscopic evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract.

• E. Streptococcus pyogenes (7%)

• F. Treponema pallidum (2%).

(Choice A) Cervicofacial actinomycosis is a rare infection presenting as a slowly progressive, nontender mass that can form abscesses and draining sinus tracts with characteristic yellow "sulfur granules." Regional adenopathy is unlikely because the infection spreads by direct extension, ignoring normal tissue planes.

(Choice B) Infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may cause enlarged tonsils and lymphadenopathy. However, oropharyngeal HNSCC is much more likely given the absence of fever and the unilaterally enlarged, ulcerated tonsil with ipsilateral ﬁrm lymphadenopathy. EBV is also associated with certain lymphomas (eg, Burkitt) and with nasopharyngeal (rather than oropharyngeal) cancer, all of which are unlikely to cause unilateral tonsillar ulceration.

However, oropharyngeal HNSCC is much more likely given the absence of fever and the unilaterally enlarged, ulcerated tonsil with ipsilateral ﬁrm lymphadenopathy. EBV is also associated with certain lymphomas (eg, Burkitt) and with nasopharyngeal (rather than oropharyngeal) cancer, all of which are unlikely to cause unilateral

tonsillar ulceration.

(Choice C) Fusobacterium necrophorum causes Lemierre syndrome, a life-threatening, deep neck space infection that progresses to suppurative thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. Although it presents with painful pharyngitis and odynophagia, it also has a more acute (<1 week) and toxic presentation with high fevers (>39 C [102 F]), rigors, and respiratory distress from associated septic pulmonary emboli.

• A. Actinomyces israelii (17%)

• B. Epstein-Barr virus (15%).

(Choice E) Although Streptococcus pyogenes causes painful pharyngitis, it presents acutely with fever and would not be expected to cause persistent, unilateral, ﬁrm tonsillar enlargement with ulceration and unilateral enlarged, nontender adenopathy.

C. Fusobacterium necrophorum (24%)

D. Human papillomavirus (30%)

(Choice F) Primary syphilis (caused by Treponema pallidum) can present with a typically painless oral ulcer (chance). Chancres on the tonsil are extremely rare and would not present with adenopathy. In addition, primary syphilis typically occurs within weeks after the initial exposure (eg, unprotected sexual encounter).

• E. Streptococcus pyogenes (7%).

• F. Treponema pallidum (2%).

Educational objective:

An enlarged, ulcerated tonsil with ipsilateral cervical adenopathy is likely oropharyngeal (head and neck) squamous cell carcinoma.Human papillomavirus is the likely etiology in the absence of traditional risk factors (smoking, alcohol).

This patient has a nonhealing dental extraction site associated with local swelling, mild pain, and exposed bone. Given her treatment of osteoporosis with zoledronic acid, these ﬁndings most likely represent bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which is likely caused, at least in part, by impaired bone remodeling. It is most common in patients receiving high-dose parenteral bisphosphonates in the context of cancer therapy, but it can also occur in those taking bisphosphonates for osteoporosis.

ONJ classically presents as an area of exposed, necrotic bone following tooth extractions or other dental procedures. It may persist for extended periods (months to years) and is often asymptomatic for much of the course. The mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla. Treatment is largely supportive, including careful oral hygiene and antibacterial rinses; oral antibiotics and limited debridement are used only when needed. Because the course can be intractable, some experts advise dental consultation and completion of any anticipated dental procedures prior to initiation of bisphosphonate therapy.

(Choices A and B) Both aphthous ulcers and herpetic stomatitis present with painful oral ulcers. However, these conditions cause superﬁcial ulcerations without exposed bone that heal spontaneouslv, usually within 7-10 davs.

(Choice E) Periodontal abscess can cause pain and swelling of tissues surrounding the affected tooth, but symptoms are typically acute. Patients usually have associated fever and lymphadenopathy.

Answered correctly

(Choice F) Like ONJ, squamous cell carcinoma can present as a nonhealing oral ulceration, and biopsy is often required for deﬁnitive diagnosis. However, this patient has no other clinical features (eg, cervical lymphadenopathy) or risk factors (eg, tobacco, heavy alcohol use) for oral cancer. Her history of bisphosphonate use makes ONJ much more likely.

Educational objective:

Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is characterized by chronic swelling, mild pain, and exposed, necrotic bone.It is often triggered by tooth extractions or other invasive dental procedures. The course can be intractable, and treatment is largely supportive with careful oral hygiene and antibacterial rinses.

• Surgery (eg, stapes reconstruction) This patient has hearing loss that paradoxically improves (with regard to speech discrimination) in noisy environments, consistent with conductive hearing loss (CHL). Given her young age and family history of hearing loss at a young age, this presentation suggests otosclerosis. Otosclerosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance. It results from an imbalance of bone resorption and deposition, causing stiffening and ﬁxation of the ossicular chain (malleus, incus, stapes), primarily the stapes. Because the ossicles function as a lever connecting the tympanic membrane to the oval window to amplify sound energy, this stiffening results in CHL. As with other causes of CHL, patients with otosclerosis can have paradoxical improvement of speech understanding in a noisy environment (a

phenomenon called the paracusis of Willis), possibly because CHL dampens the competing

background noise, thereby allowing speech to be heard more clearly.

Ear examination is generally unremarkable, although excessive bony resorption can expose underlying blood vessels, leading to a reddish hue sometimes seen behind the tympanic membrane. Management involves hearing ampliﬁcation or surgical reconstruction of the stapes.

Answered correctly

(Choice B) Degeneration of neuronal cell bodies (which can occur in presbycusis) is seen in older individuals and presents with bilateral, symmetric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Unlike CHL, SNHL is characterized by worse speech understanding with increasing background noise.

(Choice C) Increased ﬂuid in the cochlea (which is thought to occur in Ménière disease) can cause a unilateral hearing loss in young adults that sometimes runs in families. However, it presents with episodic vertigo, hearing loss, and aural fullness.

02 secs

Time Spent

(Choice D) A lamellated basement membrane is characteristic of Alport syndrome, which can cause hereditary SNHL (not CHL) due to damage of the basement membrane in the cochlea. It typically presents with recurrent hematuria in childhood.

2023

(Choice E) A neoplastic growth involving CN VIII (vestibular schwannoma) would also cause a unilateral hearing loss and is sometimes hereditary (eg, neuroﬁbromatosis, type 2). However, it would present with SNHL and a normal otoscopic examination (no reddish hue).

Educational objective:

A conductive hearing loss (CHL) may show improved speech understanding in background noise. CHL in a young woman with a positive family history of hearing loss likely represents otosclerosis, which is characterized by bony overgrowth of the stapes that causes stiffening of the ossicular chain.

• ‡ Surgical excision

This patient has a persistent, white mucosal lesion (ie, leukoplakia) on the buccal mucosa that cannot be wiped off with gauze. Although leukoplakia is often a benign condition, it may represent a premalignant (eg, dysplasia) or malignant (eg, squamous cell carcinoma) lesion; therefore, biopsy is required.

Most head and neck cancers arise from squamous epithelial cells that undergo stepwise

changes progressing toward carcinoma (ie, hyperplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma in situ → invasive carcinoma). Premalignant lesions may initially manifest in the oral cavity as hyperplastic or dysplastic white (leukoplakia) or red (erythroplakia) patches. Because these

lesions are at risk of malignant transformation, they require biopsy to rule out cancer and characterize the extent of any premalignant changes.

If biopsy does not show malignancy, patients require counseling regarding risk reduction (eg, tobacco and alcohol cessation), regular examination of the oral cavity, and repeat biopsy if the lesion changes (eg, increased thickness/ﬁrmness, color changes, associated adenopathy). Surgical excision may decrease the risk of malignant transformation and can also be considered.

(Choice D) Repeated trauma from rough-edged crowns, broken teeth, or ill-ﬁtting dentures can cause chronic irritation leading to hyperkeratotic changes and leukoplakia. However, this patient's dental crowns have no sharp margins; therefore, they are unlikely to be the cause of leukoplakia, and complete removal is not indicated. In addition, biopsy should be performed now (vs in 6 months) in case any premalignant or malignant changes are present.

(Choice E) Smoking cessation should be recommended in patients with leukoplakia, whether benign or due to oral cavity carcinoma. However, biopsy should be performed now; follow-up in 6 months risks delaying diagnosis of possible malignancy.

A 62-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce for evaluation of hoarseness. He says that he has always had a deep voice, but over the past 4 months, it has become "rough" and "scratchy" and the hoarseness is constant; it does not change throughout the day. Medical history is signiﬁcant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He drinks 12 beers weekly. Vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal mucosa is dry, and oral cavity examination shows poor dentition with mild thrush seen on the lateral surfaces of the tongue bilaterally. There is no cervical adenopathy. Flexible laryngoscopy reveals a clear nasal cavity and nasopharynx. The base of tongue has normal mucosa, and the tonsils are small with no lesions. The vocal cords are mobile bilaterally. The right vocal cord is clear with a straight edge.There is a fungating, irregular mass on the left vocal cord that appears white in some areas and red in others with some blood crusting. Which of the following would most likely be seen on biopsy of this vocal cord lesion?

Explanation

This patient with persistent hoarseness and a fungating laryngeal mass has laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which accounts for >90% of lesions in the adult larynx. The most important risk factors are smoking and alcohol use. Hoarseness is often the presenting symptom, due to impaired vibration or movement of the vocal cords. Persistent hoarseness (>30 days) should always be evaluated by laryngoscopy to ensure no delay in diagnosis of possible cancer.

• A. Adenocarcinoma (2%)

• B. Aphthous ulcer (0%)

Other presenting symptoms may include dysphagia or airway obstruction due to a mass blocking passage of food or air. Patients may have referred otalgia facilitated by either the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) (which innervates both the base of tongue and the external auditory canal [EAC]) or the vagus nerve (CN X) (which innervates parts of the larynx/hypopharynx and the EAC). Hemoptysis may be seen due to tumor friability (eg, blood crusting). Regional nodal metastases manifest as cervical adenopathy.

C. Laryngeal candidiasis (3%)

D. Pemphigus vulgaris (0%)

E. Reﬂux laryngitis (0%)

F. Squamous cell carcinoma (83%)

G. Squamous papilloma (7%)

(Choice A) Adenocarcinoma is unlikely in the larynx (<1% of laryngeal malignancies). Lung adenocarcinoma shares some risk factors (eg, smoking, age) and presenting symptoms (eg, cough, hemoptysis) with laryngeal SCC but would not metastasize to the larynx.

(Choice B) Aphthous ulcers are common, painful ulcers that typically resolve in <2 weeks and are usually seen in the oral cavity (eg, tongue, buccal mucosa) rather than the larynx and would not cause hoarseness.

• H. Vocal cord polyps (2%)

(Choice C) Laryngeal candidiasis is an opportunistic infection that often occurs concurrently with oral candidiasis (thrush) in patients using corticosteroid inhalers (eg, due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). White patches or plaques on the mucosal surfaces are seen; a single, large laryngeal mass would not occur.

Wartlike proliferations described as multiple, raised, ﬁnger-shaped lesions are seen on the surface of the vocal cords. Squamous papillomas appear more uniform and do not invade deeper structures.

(Choice H) Vocal cord polyps often occur due to inefﬁcient or excessive voice use (eg, teachers, telemarketers). They can cause hoarseness due to impaired vocal cord vibration. Polyps do not invade or ulcerate.

Educational objective:

• H. Vocal cord polyps (2%)

A laryngeal ulcer in a smoker is likely squamous cell carcinoma.Persistent hoarseness should always be evaluated by laryngoscopy to ensure no delay in diagnosis of possible cancer.

A 73-year-old man is seen in the hospital due to severe left facial pain and inability to fully open his mouth. These symptoms began earlier today. Eight days ago, the patient underwent a laparotomy for intestinal obstruction. The procedure went well, and he has had several bowel movements since the operation. Medical history is signiﬁcant for dementia and colon cancer, which was diagnosed 5 years ago and is currently in remission.The patient resides in a nursing home. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. Examination shows swelling, erythema, and severe tenderness in the left preauricular area. Laboratory studies reveal a white blood cell count of 15,600/mm3. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this complication?

• A. Adequate ﬂuid intake and oral hygiene (53%)

Explanation

Suppurative parotitis

• Elderly, dehydrated, postsurgical

• Decreased oral intake (eg, NPO perioperatively)

Risk factors

• Medications (eg, anticholinergics)

• Obstruction (eg, calculi, neoplasm)

• Firm, erythematous pre/postauricular swelling

• Exquisite tenderness exacerbated by chewing and palpation

Clinical presentation

• Trismus, systemic ﬁndings (eg, fever, chills)

• Elevated serum amylase without pancreatitis

• B. Administration of polysaccharide vaccine (10%).

• Ultrasound or CT scan (eg, ductal obstruction, abscess)

C. Administration of tetanus toxoid (7%)

• Hydration, oral hygiene

D. Avoidance of extreme jaw opening during intubation (21%)

E. Avoidance of volatile anesthetic agents during surgery (3%)

Management

• Antibiotics

• Massage (ie, milking pus out of gland)

• Sialagogues

• F. Encouragement of incentive spirometry (1%)

• G. Initiation of early ambulation (2%)

This elderly patient with fever, leukocytosis, and severe tenderness and swelling of the left parotid gland following a recent surgical procedure likely has acute suppurative parotitis.

Complications are common following rhinoplasty, and up to one in four rhinoplasties may need revision. Common complications include patient dissatisfaction, nasal obstruction and epistaxis. Those that involve the nasal septum are less common but more serious. The septum is made up of cartilage and has poor blood supply contrasting sharply with the rich anastomosing blood supply of the nasal sidewall. The underlying cartilage relies completely on the overlying mucosa for nourishment by diffusion. Because of the poor regenerating capacity of the septal cartilage, trauma or surgery on the septum may result in septal perforation. The typical postoperative presentation is a whistling noise heard during respiration. Following nasal surgery, septal perforation is typically the result of a septal hematoma though a septal abscess may also be the cause. Additional conditions that can cause septal perforation are self-inﬂicted trauma (nose picking), syphilis, tuberculosis, intranasal cocaine use, sarcoidosis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's).

(Choice B) Nasal polyps are usually seen in patients with asthma and allergic disorders but may also occur in patients with other inﬂammatory conditions of the nasal mucosa. They may cause chronic nasal obstruction and should be surgically removed in symptomatic patients.

(Choice C) Foreign bodies are common in children. On presentation, patients will have nasal obstruction and may have a foul odor, halitosis and nasal bleeding. Following surgery, a retained foreign body such as nasal packing most classically would cause toxic shock

syndrome.

(Choice D) Allergic rhinitis commonly presents with rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, cough and occasionally dyspnea. On examination, the nasal mucosa is edematous and pale, and polyps may be present.

(Choice E) Nasal furunculosis results from staphylococcal folliculitis following nose picking or nasal hair plucking. It is potentially life threatening as it can spread to the cavernous sinus. Patients complain of pain, tenderness and erythema in the nasal vestibule.

Educational objective:

If a patient develops a whistling noise during respiration following rhinoplasty, one should

suspect nasal septal perforation likely resulting from a septal hematoma.

Medical history includes asthma and gastrosophageal reﬂux disease. Medications include inhaled budesonide, albuterol, and omeprazole. The patient smokes 3 or 4 cigarettes per day. Vital signs are within normal limits. Flexible laryngoscopy shows irregular, exophytic growths in clusters on the surfaces of the vocal cords. Pathology shows no malignant features.

papillomas, nave aark-rea punciate areas corresponaing to blood vessels. Laryngeal papillomas are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes 6 and 11. Infants typically acquire HPV via vertical transmission; adults may develop symptoms due to reactivation of vertically transmitted HPV or from exposure to HPV through sexual contact.

Although benign, RRP is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity (eg, voice outcomes, airway obstruction, repeated operative interventions). In addition, the clinical course is variable and unpredictable with ﬂuctuations in severity. In rare instances, it can spread beyond the vocal cords to involve the lower respiratory tract. Medical therapy (eg, interferon, cidofovir) has limited efﬁcacy; therefore, the mainstay of treatment remains surgical debridement, and patients often require many procedures.

(Choice D) Gastroesophageal reﬂux may affect the larynx and cause hoarseness and laryngeal lesions such as focal swelling, erythema, or granulation tissue. However, it generally has a ﬂuctuating course (often worse when laying down) and would not cause wartlike growths. (Choice F) Polyps and nodules can form on the vocal cords due to chronic irritation from vocal abuse (eg, yelling or using voice excessively). However, both polyps and nodules tend to have more smooth edges and would not form in clusters.

Human papillomavirus can cause recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, which results in

hoarseness due to wartlike growths on the true vocal cords.

Vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, the patient has an avulsed left central incisor with a small amount of dry blood in the socket. The remainder of the teeth are stable without fractures. There is no injury to the gum or palate. There is no mandibular or maxillary tenderness or instability, and neurologic examination is normal. The patient has the avulsed tooth with her in a tissue, and it appears intact. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

B. Place the tooth in an ice-ﬁlled bag and advise follow-up with the dentist (19%)

This patient has had a traumatic avulsion of a permanent tooth, and the tooth is present. The tooth and the socket should be rinsed gently with normal saline and then reimplanted.

After evaluation to ensure there are no concurrent life-threatening injuries, avulsed permanent teeth should be reimplanted. Ideally, this should be done within 15 minutes to 1 hour to increase the likelihood of tooth survival (Choice B). Until reimplantation takes place, the avulsed tooth can be stored in cold milk, saliva, or tooth culture media (eg, Hank's balanced salt

solution).

D. Rinse the tooth and socket gently with normal saline; reimplant and splint the tooth

Prior to reimplantation, dental block can be performed to minimize pain. The tooth and socket should be rinsed gently with normal saline or tap water. Sterilizing agents (eg, hydrogen peroxide) or forceful scrubbing should be avoided to prevent damage to the tooth and/or socket (Choice C). The tooth should be handled by the crown, placed in the socket, and splinted to the adjacent teeth. Patients are discharged with prophylactic antibiotics (eg, doxycycline) and advised to follow-up with a dentist as soon as possible for deﬁnitive care.

(Choice A) An avulsed primary tooth should not be reimplanted because it could injure the developing tooth bud. However, an avulsed permanent tooth should be reimplanted as soon as possible; disposal is not appropriate.

A 57-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up after recent thyroid surgery. A month

Explanation

ago, he was found to have a solitary thyroid nodule, and a ﬁne-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass revealed a neoplasm arising from parafollicular cells. He underwent an uncomplicated total thyroidectomy and removal of surrounding lymph nodes. He feels well and is taking levothyroxine as prescribed. Medical history is otherwise signiﬁcant for wellcontrolled hypertension.The patient has no family history of thyroid cancers, and germline RET mutation testing was negative. Vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, there is a well-healing incision on his lower anterior neck with no surrounding erythema or edema. There are no enlarged cervical lymph nodes. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Blood cell counts and serum chemistry studies are within normal limits. Periodic surveillance with which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?

This patient has medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a neuroendocrine malignancy arising from the calcitonin-secreting parafollicular C cells. Most cases of MTC are sporadic, although approximately 25% are due to germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 [MEN2], characterized by: MTC; pheochromocytoma; and either parathyroid hyperplasia [type 2A] or marfanoid habitus and mucosal neuromas [type 2B]).

• A. Antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (0%)

MTC most commonly presents as an asymptomatic thyroid nodule. A minority of patients have diarrhea and ﬂushing (due to hormone secretion by the tumor). Unless there is concomitant hyperparathyroidism (eg, MENA), serum calcium is usually normal, possibly due to downregulation of calcitonin receptors. The diagnosis of MTC is conﬁrmed with ﬁne-needle aspiration. Primary treatment is total thyroidectomy, and therefore postoperative thyroid replacement therapy (ie, levothyroxine) is necessary.

B. Dexamethasone suppression testing (0%)

C. Serum calcitonin (47%)

D. Serum parathyroid hormone (31%)

E. Serum thyroglobulin (6%)

F. Serum thyroxine (10%)

G. Thyroid scintigraphy (3%)

MTC is often metastatic at the time of diagnosis, primarily to the cervical lymph nodes and upper aerodigestive tract. Serum calcitonin levels correlate with the risk of metastasis and are measured at the time of diagnosis; they also correlate with risk of recurrence and are therefore measured serially following surgery. Carcinoembryonic antigen also correlates with disease progression and is typically measured with calcitonin.

(Choice A) Antithyroid peroxidase antibodies are associated with chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis and related disorders. They are most often assayed in patients with goiter and elevated TSH, and are not useful in following MTC.

(Choice B) The dexamethasone suppression test is used in the evaluation of hypercortisolism (ie, Cushing syndrome); suggestive manifestations include proximal muscle weakness, facial plethora, and supraclavicular fat pads. Hypercortisolism is not associated with MEN2 or sporadic MTC. It is occasionally seen in MEN1 (which is not associated with MTC), generally due to ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors or adrenal tumors.

C. Serum calcitonin (47%)

D. Serum parathyroid hormone (31%)

E. Serum thyroglobulin (6%)

F. Serum thyroxine (10%)

G. Thyroid scintigraphy (3%)

(Choices E and G) Thyroglobulin is a glycoprotein that serves as a substrate for the production of thyroid hormone. Levels are elevated in differentiated papillary/follicular thyroid cancer, for which it is used as a cancer marker, but not in MTC (which does not produce thyroid hormone). Thyroglobulin levels are also elevated in goiter, Graves disease, and thyroiditis. Similarly, thyroid scintigraphy uses radiolabeled iodine to assess iodine uptake as a marker for thyroid metabolic activity; papillary and follicular thyroid cancers take up radiolabeled iodine, but MTC does not.

(Choice F) Serum thyroxine is used in the initial diagnosis of hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Thereafter, levothyroxine dose adjustments are primarily based on serum TSH, and thyroxine measurement has little utility.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition?

Laryngeal papillomas are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes 6 and 11, which are also the subtypes most likely to cause genital warts (condyloma acuminatum), and therefore most likely acquired via vertical transmission prior to delivery (because neither vaginal nor cesarean delivery prevent transmission).

Although benign, RRP is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity (eg, voice problems, airway obstruction, repeated operative interventions). In addition, the clinical course is variable and unpredictable with ﬂuctuations in severity. In rare instances, it can spread beyond the vocal cords to involve the lower respiratory tract. Medical therapy (eg, interferon, cidofovir) has limited efﬁcacy; therefore, the mainstay of treatment remains surgical debridement, and patients often require many procedures. The incidence of RRP in children is decreasing, likely due to increased rates of maternal HPV vaccination.

B. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction (5%)

C. Inherited deﬁciency of C1 inhibitor (3%)

D. Maternally transmitted viral infection (60%)

Correct answer

(Choices B and C) Angioedema can be IgE-mediated (also with itching and urticaria) or inherited (deﬁciency of C1 esterase inhibitor) and is characterized by recurrent episodes of edema that may involve the larynx and cause hoarseness (although airway obstruction is the primary concern). However, it typically presents as discrete episodes (hours to a few days) rather than progressive hoarseness over weeks or months.

version

Thyroid nodules are common and may be diagnosed on physical examination or noted incidentally when imaging studies are obtained for other reasons. Once a thyroid nodule is found, cancer risk factors (eg, family history, radiation exposure) should be assessed by history. Physical examination should evaluate the size, mobility, and ﬁrmness of the thyroid nodule and check for the presence of enlarged cervical lymph nodes.

Serum TSH levels should be obtained, along with a thyroid ultrasound, to determine nodule size and sonographic features. Certain sonographic features (eg, microcalciﬁcations, irregular marains internal vascularity carry_a much hiaher risk of malianancy.than.othersenevstic.or

serum total thyroxine (T4) of 10 ug/dL, and serum triiodothyronine (T3) of 176 ng/dL. A thyroid ultrasound reveals a 1.4-cm left thyroid nodule with smooth margins and no

microcalciﬁcations or internal vascularity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next

step?

Serum TSH levels should be obtained, along with a thyroid ultrasound, to determine nodule size and sonographic features. Certain sonographic features (eg, microcalciﬁcations, irregular margins, internal vascularity) carry a much higher risk of malignancy than others (eg, cystic or spongiform lesions). Thyroid nodules > 1 cm with these high-risk sonographic features—and all noncystic thyroid nodules >2 cm-should undergo ﬁne-needle aspiration (FNA).

If the TSH is low, as seen here, the patient should be evaluated with radionuclide thyroid scan using iodine-123:

• A hypofunctioning ("cold") nodule (decreased isotope uptake compared to surrounding tissue) is associated with a higher risk of cancer.

• A hyperfunctioning ("hot") nodule (increased isotope uptake in the nodule with decreased surrounding uptake) is associated with a low cancer risk; therefore, FNA is not necessary

• A. CT scan of the neck (0%)

(Choice B).

B. Fine-needle aspiration (40%)

C. Radionuclide thyroid scan (50%)

D. Serum anti-thyroid peroxidase measurement (2%)

This patient who has a thyroid nodule with no concerning sonographic features and a low TSH should receive a radionuclide thyroid scan.

(Choice A) A CT scan of the neck is inferior to ultrasound for characterizing thyroid nodules. Even if a thyroid nodule is detected on CT scan, a thyroid ultrasound is still needed.

• E. Serum calcitonin measurement (1%).

• F. Serum thyroid stimulating antibody measurement (5%)

(Choice D) Anti-thyroperoxidase antibody testing can identify chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis, but it is used for patients with high TSH levels (eg, hypothyroid). (Choice E) Calcitonin is an important tumor marker in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In patients with a thyroid nodule, testing for calcitonin should be performed if there is a family history of MTC or if cytologic examination (eg, FNA) of the nodule is consistent with MTC. (Choice F) Thyroid stimulating antibodies are present in patients with Graves disease, which can result in hyperthyroidism. However, Graves disease typically causes a diffusely enlarged goiter rather than a focal nodule.

Educational objective:

The initial evaluation of thyroid nodules includes a serum TSH assay and thyroid ultrasound.

Patients with a suppressed TSH should undergo thyroid scintigraphy. Small, hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not usually require ﬁne-needle aspiration.

An adrenal mass in combination with elevated plasma metanephrines is diagnostic of pheochromocytoma.

Diagnosis is suspected clinically and conﬁrmed by thyroid function studies documenting hyperthyroidism. Treatment includes beta blockers (eg, propranolol) for symptom control, thionamides (eg, propylthiouracil) to block new hormone synthesis, iodine solution to block thyroid hormone release (given at least an hour after propylthiouracil to prevent excess iodine incorporation into thyroid hormone), and glucocorticoids to decrease peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (and treat a potential relative adrenal insufﬁciency).

(Choice A) Echocardiography can identify causes of congestive heart failure or arrhythmias (eg, abnormal valves, ventricular dysfunction). However, this patient has no features of heart failure, and echocardiography is not needed.

(Choice B) Fluid resuscitation and intravenous dexamethasone should be given to patients with suspected acute adrenal insufﬁciency. These patients will have hypotension often associated with tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and weakness.

(Choice C) Intravenous dantrolene can treat malignant hyperthermia (MH), a hypermetabolic syndrome due to volatile anesthetics leading to sustained muscle contraction and breakdown. MH typically presents with hypercarbia, sinus tachycardia, muscle rigidity, signiﬁcantly elevated creatine kinase (can reach > 10,000-20,000 U/L), hyperkalemia (due to muscle breakdown), and hyperthermia. In this patient, the presence of lid lag, the absence of muscle rigidity, and the normokalemia are more consistent with thyroid storm than MH. Her moderate creatine kinase elevation likely reﬂects muscle injury related to trauma or surgery.

(Choice D) Intravenous lorazepam can treat alcohol withdrawal, which usually presents with

tachycardia, hypertension, and altered mental status. Fever is atypical with early withdrawal but can occur with delirium tremens, which develops 72-96 hours after the last drink. This patient's history of moderate alcohol use makes withdrawal less likely, and alcohol withdrawal

This patient's acute nausea is likely due to hyponatremia induced by recent use of intranasal desmopressin. Desmopressin is an analogue of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) commonly used to treat central diabetes insipidus; it also promotes the release of von Willebrand factor, and can treat mild to moderately heavy menstrual bleeding associated with von Willebrand disease. However, since desmopressin induces physiologic effects of ADH (eg, renal water reabsorption, concentration of urine), it can cause hyponatremia and excess ADH stimulation, manifesting as syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). Therefore, serum electrolytes should be obtained ﬁrst in this patient to check for hyponatremia and rule in the diagnosis of SIADH.

There is no peripheral edema. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Expected laboratory ﬁndings in patients with SIADH include hypotonic hyponatremia (due to ADH-mediated water retention and reabsorption), high urine osmolality (ie, concentrated urine), and high urine sodium (due to increased secretion of natriuretic peptides). As seen in this patient, SIADH is also associated with euvolemia (eg, absence of edema or jugular venous distension) on physical examination. At ﬁrst, ADH-mediated water reabsorption slightly increases extracellular volume; however, increased natriuretic peptide secretion leads to sodium and water excretion, ultimately normalizing extracellular volume.

(Choice A) Although hypoxemia (eg, from pulmonary embolism) may manifest with nausea, elevated heart rate, and dizziness, this patient has no risk factors for pulmonary disease or symptoms of respiratory distress (eg, shortness of breath, chest pain).

Thyroid function tests are often abnormal in patients with severe, acute illness. Severe illness is associated with decreased peripheral 5'-deiodination of T4 to T3 due to caloric deprivation, increased glucocorticoid and inﬂammatory cytokine release, and inhibitors of 5'monodeiodinase (eg, free fatty acids). The most common pattern is low total and free T3 levels with normal T4 and TSH, often called euthyroid sick syndrome. However, many experts consider this a misnomer and believe it represents a mild transient central hypothyroid state that serves as an adaptive response to severe illness. If the underlying illness continues,

T4 and TSH levels may eventually decrease.

In general, thyroid function testing in hospitalized patients should be avoided; however, it may be necessary in certain circumstances (eg, to rule out hyperthyroidism in acute atrial fibrillation). When a euthyroid sick syndrome pattern is found, thyroid hormone supplementation does not improve clinical outcomes and is not indicated. During recovery, patients may experience a modest, transient increase in TSH, which may be misinterpreted as subclinical hypothyroidism. Therefore, follow-up testing should be delayed until the patient

Thyroid function tests are often abnormal in patients with severe, acute illness. The most common pattern is low T3 with normal T4 and TSH (ie, euthyroid sick syndrome), which may represent an adaptive response to severe illness.Thyroid hormone supplementation is not indicated for these patients, and follow-up testing should be delayed until the patient has returned to baseline health.

with symptomatic hypercalcemia (nausea, polyuria) and suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level likely due to immobilization. Hypercalcemia of immobilization is likely due to increased osteoclastic bone resorption. The risk is increased in patients with a pre-existing high rate of bone turnover (eg, younger individuals, Paget disease). The onset of hypercalcemia is usually around 4 weeks after immobilization, although patients with chronic renal insufﬁciency may develop hypercalcemia in as little as 3 days.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's hypercalcemia?

The onset of hypercalcemia due to immobilization is often insidious, and the presenting symptoms can be nonspeciﬁc. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and are effective in treating hypercalcemia of immobilization and reducing the associated bone loss.

Explanation

A 46-year-old man undergoes an elective inguinal hernia repair. After induction of general anesthesia, he is noted to be pale and tachycardic.The patient's medical history is signiﬁcant for frequent headaches, hypertension, and an anxiety disorder. His outpatient medications include lisinopril, alprazolam, and as-needed naproxen. The patient regularly drinks a 6-pack of beer on weekends but does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. Family history is unremarkable. His temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is now 250/140 mm Hg (it was 144/90 mm Hg before induction), and pulse is 125/min. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ischemic changes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

In light of this patient's history of hypertension and frequent headaches, his presentation with severe hypertension, pallor, and sinus tachycardia is concerning for an occult pheochromocytoma with a catecholamine surge due to anesthesia. Pheochromocytomas and paraganglionomas are catecholamine-producing tumors arising from chromafﬁn cells of the adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia, respectively.

• A. Alcohol withdrawal (6%)

• B. Anaphylaxis (5%)

C. Panic disorder (2%)

Hypertension in pheochromocytoma can be intermittent or sustained. Paroxysms of severe hypertension can be precipitated by increases in intra-abdominal pressure (eg, tumor palpation, positional changes), surgical procedures, and a number of medications, particularly anesthetic agents. In addition, nonselective beta blockers can cause a state of unopposed alpha adrenergic stimulation leading to vasoconstriction and paradoxical hypertension. For this reason, alpha adrenergic blockers (eg, phenoxybenzamine) should be administered prior to beta blockers in patients with pheochromocytoma.

D. Pheochromocytoma (52%)

• E. Serotonin syndrome (11%)

• F. Thyroid storm (22%)

(Choices A, C, and F) Alcohol withdrawal and panic disorder can mimic pheochromocytoma paroxysms but are unlikely to manifest when the patient is under anesthesia. Thyroid storm can be precipitated by surgery in patients with preexisting thyrotoxicosis, but the presentation is usually less acute, and almost all patients will have pyrexia. Severely elevated blood pressure and pallor (from catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction) are more likely due to catecholamine surge from pheochromocytoma.

(Choice B) Anaphylaxis is a severe type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to a drug, environmental agent, or food. Anaphylaxis typically causes hives, angioedema, respiratory compromise, and acute hypotension rather than hypertension.

Version

(Choice E) Serotonin syndrome is characterized by abnormal mental status, autonomic

hyperactivity, and muscular rigidity with hyperreflexia. It is typically triggered by initiation or

titration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Educational objective:

Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-producing tumors arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Paroxysms of severe hypertension in patients with pheochromocytoma can

be precipitated by surgical procedures, induction of anesthesia, and a number of medications.

This patient has paresthesias, carpal spasm (Trousseau sign), and hyperreﬂexia. In the setting of high-volume transfusion, these neurologic features are most likely due to hypocalcemia. Other potential features of severe hypocalcemia include tetany, laryngospasm, seizures, encephalopathy, and heart failure. Patients with chronic hypocalcemia may have only mild symptoms, but patients with acute hypocalcemia will have more severe manifestations at the same calcium concentration.

Citrate in transfused blood binds ionized calcium, which is the biologically active fraction (total calcium levels will not be signiﬁcantly affected). Hypocalcemia is uncommon following blood transfusion in patients with normal liver function as citrate is rapidly metabolized by the liver; however, this patient likely has hepatic dysfunction due to the liver laceration as well as ischemic liver injury due to hypotension. Other infused substances that can chelate calcium in the blood include lactate, foscarnet, and sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).

Explanation

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism

• Longstanding chronic kidney disease/end-stage renal disease

Risk factors

• Chronic hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia

• Parathyroid hyperplasia

Pathogenesis

• Loss of feedback inhibition of PTH by calcium

• Very high PTH

Laboratory diagnosis • Mild/moderate hypercalcemia

Treatment

• Parathyroidectomy is often needed

• A. Decreased clearance of parathyroid hormone (25%) ) B. Ectopic production of parathyroid hormone (11%)

• D. Increased activation of vitamin D (9%)

• E. Plasma protein-mediated pseudohypercalcemia (6%)

PTH = parathyroid hormone.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with hypocalcemia due to decreased renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the more active form). Concurrently, decreased glomerular ﬁltration leads to inadequate clearance of plasma phosphate. The resulting hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia stimulate secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to high circulating PTH levels (ie, secondary hyperparathyroidism).

In patients with long-standing CKD, especially those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD),

chronic parathyroid stimulation can lead to parathyroid hyperplasia. This is associated with autonomous PTH secretion (ie, not suppressed by rising calcium levels) due to

downregulation of calcium-sensing receptor and vitamin D receptor in the parathyroid glands.

A 68-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce for follow-up. The patient has a 10-year history of end-stage renal disease due to diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy and receives intermittent hemodialysis. Current medications are losartan, metoprolol, amlodipine, shortand long-acting insulins, and epoetin alpha. His calcium acetate and calcitriol therapy were stopped 3 months ago due to an elevated serum calcium level. The patient is adherent with medications and dietary restrictions. Laboratory results are as follows:

Calcium Phosphorus Albumin

10.8 mg/dL

5.1 mg/dL

3.8 g/dL

Parathyroid hormone, intact 760 pg/mL

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's elevated serum

calcium level?

This patient has hypercalcemia despite discontinuation of calcium and calcitriol therapy. In the setting of ESRD, hyperphosphatemia, and a very high PTH level, this presentation is consistent with tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

(Choice A) PTH is a peptide hormone that is metabolized primarily in the liver. Although a lesser amount is metabolized in the kidneys, intact renal function is not necessary for clearance of PTH.

(Choice B) Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is characterized by ectopic production of PTH-related peptide and is a common cause of paraneoplastic hypercalcemia. Ectopic production of intact PTH is a very rare paraneoplastic syndrome and is not the cause of tertiary hyperparathyroidism in ESRD.

(Choice D) Activation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is dependent on

• A. Decreased clearance of parathyroid hormone (25%) ) B. Ectopic production of parathyroid hormone (11%)

• C. Hyperplasia of parathyroid glands (46%).

• D. Increased activation of vitamin D (9%)

• E. Plasma protein-mediated pseudohypercalcemia (6%)

renal expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase, which is decreased (not increased) in patients with CKD. Furthermore, excessive activation of vitamin D would suppress PTH production.

(Choice E) Calcium circulates in a protein-bound fraction and a non-protein-bound ionized fraction. Pseudohypercalcemia refers to an elevated total serum calcium level due to excessive levels of serum proteins (eg, albumin, immunoglobulin) with a normal ionized calcium level. These patients are in a physiologically eucalcemic state with normal PTH levels.

A 62-year-old man with an extensive history of tobacco use comes to the ofﬁce for follow-up 10 days after undergoing total laryngectomy and unilateral modiﬁed radical neck dissection. The patient had advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with erosion completely through the thyroid cartilage with cervical lymph node involvement. The operation was complicated by excessive bleeding, but the immediate postoperative course was uneventful. The patient has not yet received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy. Today the patient is able to communicate well with an electrolarynx. He reports fatigue, irritability, memory difﬁculties, muscle aches, and tingling in both hands and feet. The patient says he has also been sleeping more than usual and feels depressed. Appetite is normal, and he has no suicidal ideation. Vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, the patient appears anxious but fully oriented. The surgical site is healing well with no erythema or discharge; the stoma is clean and open with no crusting. Lung and heart sounds are normal. Neurologic examination shows normal recall and attention. Deep tendon reﬂexes are 3+ in all 4 extremities with normal muscle tone and strength.

This patient has affective symptoms (eg, irritability, depressed mood) and features of neuromuscular excitability (eg, paresthesia, diffuse hyperreﬂexia). In the acute postsurgical phase following neck surgery, this presentation suggests iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism can occur after anterior neck procedures (eg, thyroidectomy, lymph node dissection) due to direct injury, inadvertent removal, or devascularization to the parathyroid glands. Initial symptoms may be vague and nonspeciﬁc, but more severe manifestations may include tetany (eg, carpal spasm, Trousseau sign), QT interval prolongation, and/or seizure.

Laboratory ﬁndings in hypoparathyroidism include hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and a low (or inappropriately normal) parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (reﬂecting total body stores) is generally normal, whereas 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (which requires PTH-mediated activation by 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys) may be low. Patients with mild hypocalcemia (eg, corrected serum calcium >7.5 mg/dL, mild symptoms) can generally be managed with oral calcium and vitamin D (calcitriol), but patients with severe

However, brain metastases often cause focal neurologic ﬁndings (eg, hemiparesis, pupillary changes) and may be associated with increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea, vomiting). Given his recent neck surgery, the patient's serum calcium should be checked ﬁrst.

• D. Obtain serum calcium level (60%)

• E. Obtain thyroid function studies (32%)

(Choice E) Hypothyroidism can cause neurocognitive and affective symptoms; however, reﬂexes are delayed rather than increased. In addition, thyroxine has a very long half-life (several days), so iatrogenic hypothyroidism is unlikely to be symptomatic so soon after

Hypoparathyroidism can be caused by direct parathyroid injury or devascularization during surgical procedures in the anterior neck. Initial neurocognitive or affective symptoms may be nonspeciﬁc, but acute hypocalcemia may also cause paresthesia, hyperreﬂexia, tetany, or seizure. Laboratory ﬁndings include hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and a low parathyroid hormone level.

A 45-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to left groin and abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, hypertension, and glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia. Abdominal examination shows central obesity; skin striae; and a nonreducible, tender mass in the left groin. CT scan of the abdomen reveals a left femoral hernia containing a bowel segment and dilated small bowel loops. The patient undergoes urgent exploratory laparotomy for resection of the obstructed bowel loop and repair of the hernia. There are no intraoperative complications, but she abruptly develops hypotension in the postoperative recovery unit. Blood pressure remains <90/60 mm Hg despite intravenous ﬂuid boluses.

Several aspects of this patient's presentation suggest that her refractory, acute-onset hypotension following surgery is due to adrenal crisis. Adrenal crisis can develop in the setting of an acute stressor (eg, illness, surgery) in patients with adrenal insufﬁciency (Al) (eg, chronic primary Al, secondary Al). This patient's history of systemic lupus erythematous (which often requires prednisone therapy for ﬂares) and evidence of hypercortisolism (eg, central obesity, purple striae, glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia) suggest chronic glucocorticoid therapy. Patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy can develop hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis suppression and secondary Al. Because their pituitary gland is unable to increase ACTH secretion when needed (eg, acute stressor), these patients are at high risk of acute Al (adrenal crisis).

Adrenal crisis primarily presents with hypotension and shock; hypoglycemia is also usually

present. Adrenal crisis due to secondary Al may present less dramatically than that due to

primary Al because only cortisol is deﬁcient and angiotensin Il-mediated aldosterone production remains intact (primary Al involves loss of both cortisol and aldosterone). However, cortisol does play an important role in maintaining vascular tone, and isolated cortisol deﬁciency can lead to hemodynamic collapse.

Family history is signiﬁcant for breast cancer in her mother. Examination shows mild vaginal dryness. The remainder of the physical examination, including visual ﬁelds, is normal. Laboratory results are as follows:

This patient has hyperprolactinemia, likely due to a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma). Prolactin suppresses production of GnRH in the hypothalamus, leading to decreased release of FSH and LH, manifesting as central hypogonadism. In premenopausal women, this typically presents with anovulation, oligo/amenorrhea, and infertility.

The resultant estrogen deﬁciency can cause vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot ﬂashes), vaginal dryness and atrophy, and dyspareunia. Because estrogen maintains bone mass in premenopausal women, prolonged estrogen deﬁciency can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk for fragility fractures.

Serum chemistry Creatinine

Endocrine

1.1 mg/dL

100 ng/mL (normal: <20)

Therefore, all patients with hyperprolactinemia causing hypogonadal symptoms warrant treatment. Other indications for treatment of hyperprolactinoma include galactorrhea and, in those with larger adenomas, mass effect symptoms (eg, headache, visual ﬁeld defects). Initial treatment usually includes dopamine agonists (eg, cabergoline, bromocriptine), which suppress prolactin production; transsphenoidal surgery is considered for patients who do not respond adequately to dopamine agonists.

A pregnancy test is negative. MRI reveals a 7 mm pituitary microadenoma. The most important reason for treating this patient now is to prevent which of the following?

(Choices B and C) Chronic unopposed estrogen exposure (eg, due to obesity, chronic anovulation) can increase the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Hyperestrogenism may also increase the risk for other estrogen-sensitive cancers (eg, breast). However, the oligo/amenorrhea associated with hyperprolactinemia is characterized by low, not high, estrogen levels.

• A. Bone loss (49%)

B. Breast cancer (3%)

C. Endometrial cancer (5%)

D. Permanent infertility (18%)

(Choice D) Treatment of hyperprolactinemia with dopamine agonists can restore fertility in most patients. Although menstruation may not normalize for a few months after initiation of treatment, prolonged treatment is effective in most cases.

• E. Rapid increase in adenoma size (23%)

(Choice E) Macroadenomas (ie, >1 cm) may undergo a rapid increase in size, leading to mass effect symptoms. However, rapid enlargement is quite rare (≤5%) in microadenomas, which often remain stable in size for several years; rapid enlargement of these may suggest a

(Choices B and C) Chronic unopposed estrogen exposure (eg, due to obesity, chronic anovulation) can increase the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Hyperestrogenism may also increase the risk for other estrogen-sensitive cancers (eg, breast). However, the oligo/amenorrhea associated with hyperprolactinemia is characterized by low, not high, estrogen levels.

Prolactin, serum Thyroid function tests

TSH

(Choice D) Treatment of hyperprolactinemia with dopamine agonists can restore fertility in most patients. Although menstruation may not normalize for a few months after initiation of treatment, prolonged treatment is effective in most cases.

A pregnancy test is negative. MRI reveals a 7 mm pituitary microadenoma. The most important reason for treating this patient now is to prevent which of the following?

• A. Bone loss (49%)

(Choice E) Macroadenomas (ie, >1 cm) may undergo a rapid increase in size, leading to mass effect symptoms. However, rapid enlargement is quite rare ($5%) in microadenomas, which often remain stable in size for several years; rapid enlargement of these may suggest a malignant lesion.

B. Breast cancer (3%)

C. Endometrial cancer (5%)

D. Permanent infertility (18%)

Educational objective:

• E. Rapid increase in adenoma size (23%)

Prolactin suppresses production of GRH in the hypothalamus, leading to decreased release of FSH and LH and central hypogonadism. In premenopausal women, this presents with anovulation, oligo/amenorrhea, and infertility. The resultant estrogen deﬁciency can lead to osteoporosis. Therefore, all patients with hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadal symptoms warrant treatment (eg, dopamine agonists).

A 58-year-old man comes to the urgent care center with a 2-week history of an ulcer on his right foot. He recalls no injury and found a "dime sized" ulcer on the bottom of the foot after noticing soakage on his sock. The patient has been cleaning the wound with antiseptics and applying topical antibiotics, but it has failed to heal. He has had no pain, surrounding redness, fever, or chills. The patient was diagnosed with hypertension several years ago but had no follow-up with a physician. He takes ibuprofen for occasional back pain. The patient has a 30-pack-year smoking history and drinks 1 or 2 beers daily. He works in a warehouse, where he is "constantly on the move" and considers himself to be in good health. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 156/98 mm Hg, and pulse is 88/min. BMI is 32 kg/m. On examination, the feet are warm and dry. A 2-cm nontender ulcer is present on the sole of the foot just below the head of the ﬁrst metatarsal bone. There is scant discharge and necrotic tissue at the ulcer bed, but the bone probe is negative. Which of the following will most likely diagnose the underlying cause of this patient's foot ulcer?

Explanation

Diabetic foot ulcers

• Chronically uncontrolled diabetes

• Diabetic neuropathy (decreased protective sensation)

Risk factors

• Foot deformity & small muscle atrophy

• End-stage renal disease/dialysis

• Plantar surface under pressure points (eg, bony prominences)

• Painless ulcer

Presentation

• "Punched out" appearance with necrotic base

• Often with adjacent callus

• A. Ankle-brachial index measurement (12%)

• B. Culture from the ulcer bed (1%)

• C. Duplex venous ultrasonography (2%)

Neuropathic ulcers are caused by repeated pressure, friction, or trauma due to lack of sensation in the local tissues. They typically occur at weight-bearing sites (eg, head of the ﬁrst metatarsal) on the sole of the foot. The location of this patient's ulcer and the lack of associated pain are consistent with a neuropathic ulcer.

D. Hemoglobin A1c assay (82%)

• E. MRI of the lumbosacral spine (0%)

• F. Vasculitis serologic markers (0%)

Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of neuropathic ulcers. Whereas neuropathy involving small nerve ﬁbers typically causes pain and paresthesia, involvement of large ﬁbers produces sensory loss that can allow minor injuries to go unrecognized until the development of an ulcer. Associated autonomic dysregulation can lead to decreased sweating and skin ﬁssuring and further increase the risk for ulceration.

In addition to the ulcer, this patient has other risk factors for diabetes (eg, obesity,

hypertension). Peripheral neuropathy can be present at the time of type 2 diabetes mellitus

This patient has diffuse enlargement of the breasts without pain, tenderness, nodules, or skin dimpling. In light of the chronicity, underlying obesity, and lack of hypogonadal (eg, loss of erections) and pituitary (eg, headache) symptoms, this most likely represents pseudogynecomastia (also called lipomastia).

version

Pseudogynecomastia is characterized by excessive deposition of fat in the breast, which commonly extends into the axilla and skin folds without a distinct margin. In contrast, in true gynecomastia (ie, enlargement of the glandular breast tissue), the margin of ﬁrm glandular tissue is often palpable and the breast may be tender. The diagnosis is usually apparent on clinical ﬁndings (ie, body habitus, palpation). Management includes weight loss, which is usually adequate. Liposuction or surgical reduction can be considered, but risks include scarring, asymmetry, and poor cosmetic results.

A 33-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce for follow-up of a thyroid nodule that was discovered incidentally on a routine physical examination 3 weeks ago. The patient feels well and has experienced no weight changes, temperature intolerance, or menstrual irregularities. Medical history is notable for primary hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine. Family history is notable for hypertension and hypothyroidism in her mother, but the patient has no relatives with a history of thyroid cancer. TSH is normal. Neck ultrasound reveals a 2.0-cm hypoechoic nodule in the right lobe of her thyroid without any enlarged lymph nodes. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy reveals large cells with ground glass cytoplasm, and pale nuclei containing inclusion bodies and central grooving consistent with papillary thyroid cancer. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this

patient?

Explanation

Surgical resection is the primary treatment for papillary thyroid cancer. The extent of

surgery depends on the tumor size, extrathyroidal invasion, patient age, and lymph node involvement. Small tumors (<1-2 cm) without evidence of lymph node involvement or contralateral thyroid abnormalities can usually be managed with partial thyroidectomy/lobectomy, whereas larger tumors usually warrant total thyroidectomy. In addition, regional lymph node or central compartment lymph node dissection is usually performed for papillary cancer with lymph node metastasis or extrathyroidal invasion.

• A. Antithyroid peroxidase antibody assay (0%)

B. Genetic mutation analysis in ﬁne-needle aspiration biopsy sample (2%)

C. Measurement of serum calcitonin (2%)

D. Radioactive iodine ablation (6%)

Following surgery, adjuvant therapy with radioiodine ablation is warranted for patients with increased risk of tumor recurrence (eg, large tumors, extrathyroidal invasion, lymph node metastasis, incomplete resection) (Choice D). TSH can stimulate growth of occult residual or metastatic disease. For this reason, patients at increased risk of recurrence should also receive adequate doses of thyroid replacement to suppress TSH secretion.

(Choice A) Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are a marker for chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. TPO antibodies are useful in the initial evaluation of hypothyroidism and diffuse goiter but have no utility in evaluation of papillary thyroid cancer.

/ • E. Surgical resection (84%)

• F. Thyroid scintigraphy (3%)

(Choice B) Mutations of several genes (eg, BRAF, RET) are common in papillary thyroid cancer. Genetic mutation proﬁling may be performed when the cytology results from ﬁneneedle aspiration biopsy are indeterminate but are not needed if cytology conﬁrms papillary

A 39-year-old woman who recently underwent thyroidectomy for Grave's disease complains of anxiety, muscle cramps, and poor sleep. Her medications include daily multivitamin supplements and lansoprazole for acid reﬂux disease. Her temperature is 36.6 C (98 F), blood pressure is 142/85 mm Hg, and pulse is 82/min. Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with prolongation of the corrected QT interval to 510 msec (normal <460 msec). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Explanation

• A. Hyperkalemia (9%)

B. Hypocalcemia (85%)

C. Hyponatremia (0%)

Post-surgical hypoparathyroidism can occur during thyroidectomy or from the removal of 3 1/2 parathyroid glands due to parathyroid hyperplasia.Hypocalcemia is the resultant condition of the hypoparathyroidism and the most common complication of thyroidectomy. Patients with hypocalcemia can be asymptomatic at initial presentation (found incidentally) or may complain only of nonspeciﬁc symptoms (eg, fatigue, anxiety, depression).involuntary contractions (tetany) involving the lips, face, and extremities and seizures are seen in severe hypocalcemia. Electrocardiogram may show QT-interval prolongation.

• D. Persistent hyperthyroidism (3%)

• E. Vitamin D toxicity (1%)

(Choice A) Hyperkalemia is not a common postoperative complication of thyroidectomy. (Choices C and D) Persistent hypothyroidism (not hyper) can be seen post-thyroidectomy and can cause hyponatremia without thyroid hormone supplementation.

for this patient?

©uWorld This patient's diffusely warm, erythematous breast with thickened skin dimpling is classic for inﬂammatory breast carcinoma (IBC). This rare, aggressive cancer is typically rapid in onset (eg, within months) and painful.

IBC can be clinically confused with an infectious process (eg, mastitis) due to the common symptoms of pain, erythema, and warmth. However, mastitis rapidly improves and resolves with antibiotics in most patients; therefore, patients who have limited or no improvement on antibiotic therapy require further evaluation for IBC or worsening infection (eg, breast abscess). Unlike breast abscess (which typically presents with a tender, ﬂuctuant mass), IBC causes cutaneous edema, leading to a thickened peau d'orange appearance (eg, superﬁcial skin dimpling, ﬁne pitting) that is not usually seen with infection (Choices A and F).

• A. Breast abscess (18%)

• B. Fat necrosis (1%)

• C. Inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma (6%)

• D. Inﬂammatory breast carcinoma (64%)

• E. Lobular breast carcinoma (0%),.

• F. Mastitis (7%)

Omitted

Other possible signs and symptoms of IBC include itching, a palpable breast mass, and nipple changes (eg, ﬂattening/retraction). Patients commonly have axillary lymphadenopathy that suggests metastatic disease, which is present in 20% of newly diagnosed patients (but not clinically evident in this patient). Evaluation includes mammography and ultrasound of the breast and axillary lymph nodes. Tissue biopsy is necessary to conﬁrm the diagnosis. (Choice B) Fat necrosis typically presents as an ill-deﬁned, ﬁrm breast mass with irregular borders and a history of local breast trauma or surgery. Cutaneous ﬁndings may be absent or may manifest as localized ecchymosis, not diffuse erythema.

(Choices C and E) Inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma or lobular breast carcinoma may cause skin dimpling or breast contour changes. In contrast to IBC, these types of breast cancer do not cause diffuse breast erythema, edema, and a peau d'orange appearance.

A 41-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce for evaluation of a lump on her left breast she ﬁrst noticed 3 months ago while exercising. She feels well and has no other symptoms. The patient has no medical history and takes a daily multivitamin. Her only surgery was a bilateral tubal ligation last year. Menses are monthly and regular. Physical examination of the left breast reveals a 4-cm mass at the 11-o'clock position along with 2 irregularly enlarged, nontender axillary lymph nodes. Mammography shows irregular microcalciﬁcations. Percutaneous core needle biopsy returns with high-grade inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma, and immunohistochemical testing reveals that the tumor is estrogen/progesterone receptor negative and human epidermal growth factor type 2 (Her-2) positive. Which of the following is the single most important prognostic factor for this

patient's cancer?

Explanation

The single most important prognostic factor for breast cancer is tumor stage based on the TNM staging system. The TNM staging system describes disease burden and the degree of invasion/spread based on:

• primary Tumor size (T)

• regional lymph Node involvement (N)

• and presence of distant Metastases (M)

• A. Estrogen and progesterone receptor status (7%)

• B. Her-2/neu oncogene expression status (17%)

• C. Histologic grade of the tumor (8%)

• D. Menopausal status (0%)

Low stage is when the tumor remains conﬁned to the site of origin (eg, breast); higher stages are when there is regional (eg, axillary lymph node) or distant (eg, liver) spread. Typically, greater tumor size and spread, indicating a higher stage and greater tumor burden, is associated with a poorer prognosis (eg, lower overall survival and recurrence-free survival).

V • E. Tumor stage (66%)

Omitted

Correct answer

(Choice A) Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status are important prognostic factors. ER- and PR-negative tumors, as in this patient, have a worse prognosis and poor response to endocrine therapies (eg, tamoxifen) that lower estrogen levels. However, tumor stage, which is more reﬂective of disease burden, is more prognostic than hormone receptor status.

A 39-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce for evaluation of breast pain. The patient has had persistent right-sided breast pain for the past 2 months. She has had no breast trauma or changes in activity. The patient has no chronic medical conditions, and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Family history is signiﬁcant for a female paternal cousin with breast cancer at age 58. Temperature is 98.8 F (37.1 C), blood pressure is 106/64 mm Hg, and pulse is 88/min. There is dense breast tissue bilaterally. The right breast has localized tenderness immediately lateral to the areola, at the 9 o'clock position. There are no skin changes or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

Mastalgia (breast pain) is a common symptom in women and is usually caused by normal estrogen and progesterone ﬂuctuations associated with the menstrual cycle. This type of physiologic breast pain is typically bilateral, diffuse, and cyclic (ie, onset 1-2 weeks prior to menses and resolution with menses). In the absence of a palpable breast mass, skin changes, or lymphadenopathy, these patients may undergo repeat examination and observation because there is low risk for malignancy (Choice E).

In contrast, patients with any of the following concerning features for malignancy require further evaluation:

• A. BRCA testing (0%).

• Unilateral dreast pain

B. Breast imaging (76%)

• Persistent, noncyclic breast pain

C. Change to nonhormonal contraception (7%)

D. Core needle biopsy (3%)

E. Repeat breast examination in 1 month (13%)

• Focal pain and tenderness, which may indicate tumor compression or local invasion of surrounding benign breast tissue, even if there is no palpable mass on clinical breast

Therefore, this patient with unilateral, focal, and noncyclic breast pain requires further evaluation with breast imaging due to an increased risk of malignancy. Breast ultrasound with or without mammography is indicated in this patient with dense breast tissue. Abnormal imaging requires tissue biopsy (eg, core needle biopsy).

(Choice A) BRCA testing is indicated for family history of breast cancer in ≥2 ﬁrst-degree relatives (1 of whom is diagnosed at age ≤50). A single second-degree relative (eg, paternal cousin) with breast cancer diagnosed at age >50 is not an indication because BRCA mutation is unlikely.

(Choice C) Although oral contraceptives can cause breast pain and tenderness, these symptoms are typically bilateral and usually occur at the time of initiation rather than with regular use.Therefore, discontinuing this patient's oral contraceptive and changing to a

nonhormonal contraceptive method is not indicated.

A 24-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce due to a breast lump. She is unsure how long it has been present, but recently it has started to bother her during exercise with a noticeable pulling or tugging sensation. The patient's menses are regular, occurring every 26 days with 2 days of heavy bleeding and 2 days of light ﬂow. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She is sexually active and recently started using combined estrogen/progestin oral contraceptive pills. The patient is an avid runner and wears a sports bra almost daily. Family history includes a paternal aunt who had breast cancer at age 62. Physical examination shows an ovoid 4-cm mass in the superior outer quadrant of the right breast. The mass is ﬁrm, nontender, and mobile.

B. Fat necrosis (4%)

C. Fibroadenoma (80%)

This young woman with an isolated palpable breast mass that is ovoid, ﬁrm, and mobile most likely has a ﬁbroadenoma. This benign breast condition is common in women age <30 and is often sensitive to ﬂuctuating estrogen levels. Increased estrogen levels can cause increased ﬁbroadenoma growth, which can make the mass more noticeable to the patient prior to menses or with initiation of combined estrogen/progestin oral contraceptives, as in this patient.

D. Fibrocystic changes (10%)

E. Galactocele (0%)

• F. Mammary duct ectasia (0%)

G. Phyllodes tumor (1%)

Like many benign breast masses, a ﬁbroadenoma typically presents as a small, ﬁrm, wellcircumscribed and mobile mass. Although a ﬁbroadenoma may present anywhere in the breast, it is usually solitary and commonly located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. In contrast, a malignant breast mass (eg, ductal carcinoma) is typically irregularly shaped and immobile; associated nipple discharge or lymphadenopathy may also be present (Choice A).

C. Fibroadenoma (80%)

(Choice D) Fibrocystic breast changes typically cause multiple small, cyclically tender masses and diffuse nodularity in both breasts. In contrast, this patient has a unilateral, isolated mass. (Choice E) A galactocele is a milk retention cyst of the breast caused by an obstructed duct. It typically occurs in breastfeeding patients and is usually soft and cystic rather than ﬁrm.

D. Fibrocystic changes (10%)

E. Galactocele (0%)

G. Phyllodes tumor (1%)

(Choice F) Mammary duct ectasia can present as a unilateral, isolated breast mass. However, this benign lesion is typically subareolar (not in the upper outer quadrant) and associated with nipple discharge due to inﬂammation of the subareolar breast ducts.

(Choice G) A phyllodes tumor is a rare form of breast tumor. In the early stages of growth, it has characteristics similar to those of a ﬁbroadenoma (ie, unilateral, isolated, ﬁrm, well circumscribed, mobile). However, a phyllodes tumor typically grows much larger, resulting in changes to the shape, contour, and skin (eg, necrosis) of the affected breast.

(Choice A) If mammography or ultrasonography of a breast mass yields ﬁndings that are concerning for malignancy, biopsy is required, typically image-guided core needle biopsy. Excisional biopsy (eg, lumpectomy) is typically reserved for patients with abnormal core needle biopsy results or for symptom relief of large, growing, benign breast lesions.

(Choice B) Mammography is used for initial assessment in women age ≥40; it is inferior to ultrasonography in patients age <30 due to their higher breast tissue density, which can cause false positives and lead to unnecessary biopsies.

(Choice C) MRI of the breast is used to assess for metastatic disease in patients with diagnosed breast cancer or as breast cancer screening in high-risk patients (eg, BRCA carrier). It is not used to evaluate a new breast mass because MRI has high sensitivity but low speciﬁcity for breast cancer (ie, both benign and malignant masses appear enhanced).

Educational objective:

Palpable breast masses in women age <30 are initially evaluated with ultrasonography due to increased density of breast tissue. Solid or complex-appearing masses may require additional imaging (eg, mammography) or biopsy to exclude malignancy.

A palpable breast mass requires further evaluation because physical examination alone is insufﬁcient for excluding malignancy. In women age 30-39 (eg, this 36-year-old patient), either ultrasound or mammogram can be used for ﬁrst-line imaging to evaluate palpable masses. Although screening mammograms are used in asymptomatic women, diagnostic (eg, multiple view) mammograms are used to evaluate a palpable mass or an abnormal screening result. Targeted ultrasound is used with mammography to further characterize the mass (eg, solid vs cystic). In women age <30, ultrasound is preferred for a palpable abnormality, although mammography can be used for further characterization if an abnormality (eg, irregular borders, complex cyst, indistinct borders) is seen on ultrasound.

(Choices D and E) Reassurance and reevaluation after 1 or 2 menstrual cycles (not 6 months) may be appropriate for young women (adolescents) if clinical suspicion is low. However, all palpable breast masses in adult women require further evaluation (eg, imaging, possible biopsy) because clinical examination alone is insufﬁcient at distinguishing benign versus malignant masses and because there is an increased risk for breast cancer with age.

Educational objective:

Either mammography or ultrasound can be used for the ﬁrst-line imaging study to assess a palpable breast mass in women age 30-39. Breast biopsy is frequently required to conﬁrm the diagnosis.

A 42-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce due to bloody discharge from her right nipple. She has had no breast pain, swelling, or trauma but stopped breastfeeding 3 months ago. She has never had mammography. The patient has no chronic medical conditions. Vital signs are normal. Examination reveals symmetric breasts without any ulceration, crusting, or scaling of the nipple-areolar complexes. Manual pressure elicits bloody discharge from a single duct of the right nipple. There is also a ﬁrm, ill-deﬁned, 2-cm mass palpable in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast with overlying skin retraction. The left breast is normal to palpation, and no axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is present bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

• Physiologic nipple discharge is usually bilateral, multiductal, milky or nonbloody and is expressed only with manipulation of the breast.

• Pathologic nipple discharge is usually unilateral, uniductal, bloody or serous, and

spontaneous.

Version

Physiologic nipple discharge is typically caused by a benign process outside the breast (eg, hyperprolactinemia). In contrast, pathologic nipple discharge typically signals that an abnormal process (eg, papilloma, carcinoma, abscess) is present within the breast.

This patient has pathologic, unilateral bloody nipple discharge and a ﬁrm, ill-deﬁned breast mass. This presentation is most concerning for breast cancer (eg, invasive ductal carcinoma), especially given the skin retraction overlying the mass, which is typically due to tumor invasion into the breast suspensory ligaments. Tumor growth and/or necrosis within the lactiferous duct system can result in bloody nipple discharge. As the next steps for evaluating both the

(Choice A) A breast abscess can cause a palpable breast mass with nipple discharge; however, the mass is typically ﬂuctuant (vs ﬁrm) with surrounding erythema, the discharge is typically purulent (vs bloody), and fever is usually present.

(Choice B) Lactiferous duct blockage in the ﬁrst few months following cessation of breastfeeding can lead to formation of a galactocele (ie, milk retention cyst); however, this typically presents as a soft (vs ﬁrm), cystic mass with ﬂuid (via spontaneous discharge or aspiration) that is typically milky rather than bloody.

(Choice C) Unilateral bloody discharge without a coexisting breast mass is most commonly caused by an intraductal papilloma (ie, papillary tumor originating from the breast duct lining); however, this benign growth is typically too small (≤1 cm) to be palpable on clinical breast examination. In addition, it would not cause overlying skin retraction (ie, invasion of suspensory ligaments).

Version

(Choice E) Mammary duct ectasia, characterized by subareolar ductal dilation, inﬂammation, and ﬁbrosis, can cause a palpable breast mass (from scar tissue) with nipple discharge; however, the nipple discharge is classically green-brown and sticky (vs bloody), the mass is classically subareolar (vs peripheral), and involvement of the breast suspensory ligaments (ie, skin retraction) is not expected.

Educational objective:

Unilateral, spontaneous, bloody nipple discharge accompanied by a palpable breast mass is concerning for malignancy.

• • A. Biopsy of the breast lesion (55%)

©uWorld This patient has a unilateral, pruritic breast rash with breast erythema and edema. Skin changes of the breast can occur due to various etiologies, including infection (eg, mastitis, cellulitis), trauma (eg, breastfeeding), or malignancy. In this perimenopausal patient with axillary lymphadenopathy, the most concerning etiology is malignancy, particularly inﬂammatory breast carcinoma (IBC), due to the rapid onset of symptoms.

IBC is an aggressive breast cancer characterized by invasion of dermal lymphovascular spaces, which causes lymphatic obstruction (eg, axillary lymphadenopathy) and a diffusely enlarged breast with skin edema and ﬁne dimpling (classic peau d'orange appearance). Due to early lymphatic involvement in IBC, there is typically rapid tumor growth and metastasis (ie, within months), with the potential for interval development of IBC between routine mammography screenings (as in this patient). Patients commonly have metastatic disease at

initial presentation.

• В. КОН skin scraping (18%).

• C. MRI of the breast (17%)

• D. Oral antibiotics (4%)

Patients with suspected IBC require breast biopsy (eg, core needle biopsy) and full-thickness skin punch biopsy (evaluating for the classic ﬁnding of dermal lymphatic invasion) for diagnosis. Due to high rates of metastasis, treatment for IBC is typically aggressive (eg, chemotherapy, mastectomy, radiation).

A 19-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to lower abdominal pain. The pain is intermittent and started this morning during a yoga class. The patient has also vomited twice. She has no chronic medical conditions and takes no daily medications. She is sexually active and uses a copper-containing intrauterine device for contraception. The patient's last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 104/min. Abdominal examination shows diffuse lower abdominal tenderness, left greater than right, with no rebound or guarding. Pelvic ultrasound reveals a complex left adnexal mass with absent Doppler ﬂow.

Correct answer

This patient's lower abdominal pain is consistent with ovarian torsion, or rotation of the ovary around the infundibulopelvic ligament, leading to vessel occlusion and ovarian ischemia. Ovarian torsion is commonly precipitated by physical activity, and the initial pain can be colicky in cases of partial torsion (ie, intermittent adnexal twisting and untwisting); however, when progression to complete torsion occurs, patients typically develop severe, unilateral lower abdominal pain with nausea/vomiting. The ovary can become enlarged, edematous, and tender and have associated inﬂammatory pelvic free ﬂuid.

Although ovarian torsion is usually diagnosed clinically and conﬁrmed surgically, Doppler ultrasound can support the diagnosis and decision for surgery. Ultrasound classically shows an adnexal mass (ie, the torsed ovary) with absent Doppler blood ﬂow (ie, occluded ovarian vessels), as seen in this patient; it can be normal with partial torsion (due to adnexal untwisting). Management is with emergency laparoscopy for detorsion to prevent ovarian

There is a moderate amount of free ﬂuid in the posterior cul-de-sac of the pelvis. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

(Choice A) Ovarian torsion can cause elevated CA-125 levels due to release from the ischemic ovary. However, CA-125 levels do not affect torsion management (ie, laparoscopy). In addition, CA-125 levels (classically associated with epithelial ovarian cancer) are not routinely obtained in premenopausal patients because benign conditions can increase CA-125 levels in this population.

(Choice B) CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is indicated if another diagnosis (eg, appendicitis) is suspected. This patient's ultrasound ﬁndings are classic for torsion, and surgery cannot be delayed.

D. Laparoscopy (70%)

E. Methotrexate (1%)

(Choice C) Culdocentesis can be used to sample and identify peritoneal ﬂuid from the posterior cul-de-sac via vaginal aspiration. It has largely been replaced by ultrasonography, which rapidly and accurately identiﬁes pelvic free ﬂuid and its composition (eg, blood). (Choice E) Methotrexate is a medical treatment for ectopic pregnancy. Although ectopic pregnancies can cause pain and pelvic free ﬂuid, they typically have increased, not absent, Doppler ﬂow due to rapid tissue growth.

A 44-year-old-woman comes to the emergency department due to worsening abdominal pain. Two weeks ago, the patient underwent a laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for adenomyosis. Her postoperative course was unremarkable, and the patient went home the day after the procedure. She was eating normally until 2 days ago, when she began experiencing increasing nausea and abdominal cramping after meals. Now, the patient has abdominal cramping every few minutes and has vomited her pain medication. Her last bowel movement was 3 days ago, and she has not passed ﬂatus today. Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 34 kg/m?. The abdomen is distended and tympanic on percussion. There is abdominal tenderness to palpation, but no rebound or guarding. The skin is intact over all the abdominal incisions, but the right-sided incision has an underlying tender, palpable mass. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Abdominal x-ray reveals multiple air-ﬂuid levels within the small bowel and no air in the rectum. A nasogastric tube is placed. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

• Inability to pass ﬂatus or stool if complete (no obstipation if partial)

Clinical presentation

• Distended & tympanitic abdomen

• Dilated loops of bowel with air-ﬂuid levels on plain ﬁlm or CT scan

Management

• Partial: air in colon

• Complete: transition point (abrupt cutoff), no air in colon

• C. Bowel rest and serial abdominal examinations (31%).

• Bowel rest, nasogastric tube suction, intravenous ﬂuids

D. Digital fecal disimpaction (2%)

E. Emergency laparotomy (47%)

• F. Small bowel follow-through (8%)

• Surgical exploration for signs of complications This patient with abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation (ie, no bowel movements or ﬂatus) likely has a small bowel obstruction (SBO). In the setting of recent surgery and a tender, palpable mass at the level of the incision, her obstruction is likely caused by an incisional hernia. Incisional hernias can develop at the site of any abdominal incision and reﬂect a breakdown in fascial closure. Obesity appears to be an important risk factor. Although most cases present as an asymptomatic abdominal mass, obstruction can occur, particularly with smaller hernias, because bowel can remain trapped within the small fascial defect.

SBO typically causes vomiting and abdominal distension due to backup of gastric secretions and intestinal gas. Colicky pain after meals is also common due to unproductive bowel peristalsis against the obstruction, with hyperactive bowel sounds in the early stages. SBO treatment depends on disease severity. Partial SBO, in which the bowel lumen is narrowed but not completely obstructed, typically improves with conservative management (ie, bowel rest, nasogastric tube insertion for bowel decompression, serial abdominal examinations).

In contrast, those with a complete SBO (no ﬂatus, no air in the rectum on x-ray), such as

Colicky pain after meals is also common due to unproductive bowel peristalsis against the obstruction, with hyperactive bowel sounds in the early stages. SBO treatment depends on disease severity. Partial SBO, in which the bowel lumen is narrowed but not completely obstructed, typically improves with conservative management (ie, bowel rest, nasogastric tube insertion for bowel decompression, serial abdominal examinations).

In contrast, those with a complete SBO (no ﬂatus, no air in the rectum on x-ray), such as this patient, are at increased risk of life-threatening complications (eg, bowel ischemia, perforation) that will not resolve with conservative management (Choice C). Therefore, in addition to nasogastric tube insertion for gastric decompression, these patients require emergency laparotomy to relieve the obstruction and resolve any underlying etiology (eg, incisional hernia, intraabdominal adhesions).

• A. Abdominal ultrasound (6%)

• B. Barium enema (4%)

• C. Bowel rest and serial abdominal examinations (31%).

(Choices A and F) Further imaging studies (eg, abdominal ultrasound, small bowel follow-through) are not needed in patients with complete SBO diagnosed on abdominal x-ray (eg, no rectal gas). This patient requires emergency surgery; additional testing delays treatment and increases the risk of complications.

D. Digital fecal disimpaction (2%)

E. Emergency laparotomy (47%)

• F. Small bowel follow-through (8%)

(Choices B and D) Barium enemas and digital fecal disimpaction are used to treat constipation, a large bowel disorder that appears on abdominal x-ray as impacted stool in the rectum. Neither intervention affects the small bowel.

This patient has a painful, palpable breast mass. Because history and physical examination alone are insufﬁcient for breast cancer evaluation, imaging is required. Ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women age <30 and can help assess the risk of cancer by evaluating the composition and characteristics of the mass.

On ultrasound, this patient's mass resembles a simple cyst (thin-walled, ﬂuid-ﬁlled) rather than a complex cyst (thick-walled, solid components). Complex cysts automatically require core needle biopsy due to the increased risk of underlying cancer. In contrast, asymptomatic simple cysts can be observed.

cysts can be observed. However, patients with symptomatic (ie, painful) cysts can undergo ﬁne-needle aspiration for pain relief, and further management then depends on the results of the aspiration:

• If the ﬂuid is bloody and/or the mass persists (ie, remains palpable and/or visible on ultrasound, as in this patient) despite aspiration, patients may be at increased risk for breast cancer and should undergo core needle biopsy. Biopsy provides a histologic diagnosis to guide further management, which may include surveillance (eg, repeat examinations), excisional biopsy, or tumor-directed treatment (Choice D).

• A. Breast MRI (10%)

• In contrast, if the aspirated ﬂuid is nonbloody (eg, clear, green, grey) and both the breast mass and symptoms resolve completely, patients are at low risk for cancer and require no additional management. Repeat examination and imaging are not required unless the mass or symptoms recur.

B. Core needle biopsy (58%)

C. Discontinuation of the combined oral contraceptive (6%)

D. Repeat breast examination in 1 year (22%)

(Choice A) Breast MRI is sometimes used for cancer screening in high-risk patients (eg, BRCA carrier). It is not used to evaluate a new breast mass because breast MRI has high sensitivity but low speciﬁcity for cancer (ie, both benign and malignant masses appear

enhanced).

• E. Thermography (1%)

This patient most likely has fat necrosis of the breast. This benign condition is associated with breast surgery (eg, breast reduction/reconstruction) and trauma (eg, seatbelt injury). Fat necrosis can mimic breast cancer in its clinical and radiographic presentation because it commonly presents as a ﬁxed mass with skin or nipple retraction and gives the appearance of calciﬁcations on mammography. Ultrasonography can reveal a hyperechoic mass, which often correlates with a benign etiology. Biopsy is diagnostic and typically shows fat globules and foamy histiocytes, as seen in this patient.

2023

Version

Despite benign biopsy results, the entire mass is often excised due to concerning ﬁndings of calciﬁcations on mammography and a ﬁxed irregular mass on clinical examination. Once the diagnosis is conﬁrmed with pathology, reassurance and routine follow-up are appropriate because the risk of breast cancer in these patients is not increased.

(Choices A, C, and E) Radiation and further surgery (eg, mastectomy, lymph node dissection) are not indicated for this nonmalignant condition. Prophylactic mastectomy can be considered in patients with a strong family history of breast cancer, such as a patient with ≥1 ﬁrst-degree relatives with breast cancer before age 50, or a hereditary oncogenic mutation.

A 62-year-old woman on the postoperative floor is evaluated due to increasing confusion. The patient is unable to answer questions, keeps trying to get out of bed, and continues to

pull on her intravenous lines.Six hours ago, she underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, staging, and debulking procedure for primary peritoneal cancer. After the procedure, the patient was placed on a continuous hydromorphone infusion for pain control. She was stable in the postanesthesia care unit and was moved to the postoperative ﬂoor 2 hours ago. Her medical conditions include type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which she takes insulin, and chronic hypertension. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, pulse is 116/min, and respirations are 22/min. Cardiac examination shows sinus tachycardia with no rubs or murmurs. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdominal dressing is soaked with blood, and there is blood leaking between the staples at the incision site. Finger-stick blood glucose level is 150 mg/dL. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

This postoperative patient has acute confusion (eg, inability to answer questions) and agitation (eg, pulling on lines) consistent with altered mental status (AMS) (eg, delirium). Older patients are at higher risk of postoperative delirium due to anesthesia sensitivity; however, the onset of postoperative delirium is typically immediately after a procedure. In contrast, this patient has developed acute decompensation after being previously stable and therefore requires evaluation for another precipitating cause of AMS.

A. Administer insulin dose (1%)

• B. Decrease hydromorphone infusion (6%).

• C. Order CT chest angiography (2%)

The most likely cause of AMS in this patient is hemorrhagic shock due to postoperative intraabdominal bleeding from her total abdominal hysterectomy with staging, which can be associated with large-volume blood loss and continued postoperative bleeding from friable malignant tissue. This can lead to dissection of the surgical planes by the accumulating blood and subsequent overﬂow through the incision site, as evidenced by the blood-soaked dressing and blood leaking between incisional staples. Large-volume blood loss eventually leads to hemorrhagic shock (eg, hypotension, tachycardia) and decreased end organ perfusion (eg, AMS), as in this patient.

Nipple discharge is a common breast condition and classiﬁed as either physiologic (ie, galactorrhea) or pathologic (ie, concerning for malignancy). Pathologic nipple discharge includes discharge that is unilateral, bloody, spontaneous, or associated with other breast abnormalities (eg, palpable mass, skin changes).

The most common (~50%) cause of unilateral bloody nipple discharge without a coexisting breast mass or lymphadenopathy is an intraductal papilloma. Intraductal papillomas originate from the breast duct lining and are typically nonpalpable due to their small size (≤1 cm) and intraductal location.

Although this benign condition is the most likely diagnosis, bloody nipple discharge can also be a sign of underlying breast cancer (eg, invasive ductal carcinoma) caused by tumor growth into the lactiferous duct system. Therefore, patients with pathologic nipple discharge require breast imaging with either ultrasound (age <30) or mammogram plus ultrasound (age ≥30). With small intraductal papillomas, mammography is often normal due to low sensitivity for ductal pathology; however, ultrasound may demonstrate a dilated duct due to the spaceoccupying papilloma.

This patient's unilateral, tender breast mass is consistent with a simple breast cyst, a benign breast disorder that usually occurs in women age 30-50. Presentations are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to severely painful. Whether or not they cause pain, breast cysts typically have noninvasive features on examination: they are mobile, smooth, and wellcircumscribed; associated tenderness is typically localized due to mass effect on surrounding breast parenchyma.

A 29-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the ofﬁce due to left breast pain. She noticed a painful left breast lump last week while in the shower. The lump is very sensitive to touch, making wearing a bra uncomfortable. The patient has no medical conditions and has had no prior surgeries. Family history is signiﬁcant for a cousin with breast cancer. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals a 4 × 5 x 6 cm mobile mass in the left breast. Ultrasound shows a well-circumscribed anechoic structure with a thin wall and no Doppler enhancement. No echogenic debris or solid components are seen. Needle aspiration yields clear ﬂuid with resolution of the mass. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

• A. No additional management indicated (74%)

However, because history and physical examination alone are insufﬁcient to exclude breast cancer, imaging is required. Breast ultrasound is the ﬁrst-line imaging modality in women age <30, and it can help assess the risk of cancer based on the composition and characteristics of the mass. Complex-appearing masses (eg, thick-walled, septated, solid and cystic components) are suspicious for cancer and automatically require core needle biopsy. In contrast, simple breast cysts appear thin-walled, anechoic (ie, ﬂuid-ﬁlled), and without echogenic debris or solid components.

Although asymptomatic simple cysts may be observed, symptomatic patients can undergo ﬁne-needle aspiration for pain relief. Further management then depends on aspiration

results:

• If the ﬂuid is bloody and/or the mass persists, patients may be at increased risk for breast cancer and should undergo core needle biopsy, which can provide a histologic diagnosis

B. Order a diagnostic mammogram (1%)

(Choice D).

• C. Order an MRI of the breasts (0%)

• D. Perform a core needle biopsy (1%)

• E. Send the ﬂuid for culture and cytology (22%)

• In contrast, if aspiration yields nonbloody ﬂuid (eg, clear, green, gray) and the mass resolves completely, patients are at low risk for cancer and require no additional management.

(Choices B and C) Diagnostic mammography is not recommended in women age <30 because this population typically has dense breast tissue that impedes visualization. MRI of the breasts can assess for tumor recurrence in patients diagnosed with breast cancer; however, it is not used to evaluate a new breast mass due to low speciﬁcity (ie, both benign and malignant masses appear enhanced).

Version

(Choice E) Fluid culture may be indicated for turbid or purulent ﬂuid aspirated from patients with a breast abscess (eg, fever, malaise, erythema). Cytology is typically not indicated because it has poor sensitivity and speciﬁcity for malignancy.

Educational objective:

Simple breast cysts are a common cause of palpable breast masses in women age 30-50; they are typically mobile and well-circumscribed. Fine-needle aspiration can be performed for symptomatic (ie, painful) breast cysts. Patients with nonbloody ﬂuid on aspiration and complete resolution of both the mass and symptoms require no additional management.

A 36-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce for a postoperative visit due to incisional pain. A week ago, the patient had an abdominal hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding, and intraoperative blood loss was 500 mL. After surgery, heparin was administered for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and discontinued when she started ambulating.Since leaving the hospital, the patient has had incisional pain and light vaginal bleeding. In addition, she has a pulling sensation to the left of her incision that worsens when she bends over and when she strains to have a bowel movement. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 134/78 mm Hg, and pulse is 78/min. BMI is 34 kg/m?. The abdomen is soft and there are normoactive bowel sounds. The low, horizontal abdominal incision is closed with staples, and the skin edges are intact. There is mild incisional induration but no erythema, drainage, or ﬂuctuance. The incision is diffusely tender to deep palpation, and no palpable masses or defects are present. Hemoglobin is 9 g/dL and leukocytes are 10,000/mm3. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

This patient has postoperative incisional pain after open abdominal surgery. A week after surgery, the most concerning potential cause is a wound complication, particularly in patients with risk factors (eg, obesity, increased intraabdominal pressure [eg, straining with bowel movements]). Therefore, the initial postoperative examination includes evaluation for the following:

• Infection (eg, erythema, purulent drainage, fever, leukocytosis)

• Fluid collection, as in a seroma or hematoma (eg, ﬂuctuance, serous or sanguineous drainage)

• Wound dehiscence, either superﬁcial or fascial (eg, bulge, profuse drainage)

• A. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (17%)

• B. Incisional exploration and packing (12%)

C. Observation and reassurance (51%)

• D. Oral antibiotic therapy (2%)

• E. Pelvic ultrasound (16%)

This patient is afebrile and has a normal leukocyte count, as well as a normal postoperative examination. The mild induration and diffuse tenderness to deep palpation over her incision are consistent with normal healing. Therefore, this patient requires observation and reassurance only.

(Choices A and E) If this patient's symptoms or clinical examination worsen (eg, fever, rebound or guarding), further imaging (eg, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, pelvic ultrasound) is recommended to evaluate for postoperative complications (eg, pelvic abscess).

(Choice B) Incisional exploration and packing is used to manage superﬁcial wound dehiscence (ie, skin separation with intact fascia) or subcutaneous ﬂuid collection (eg, seroma, hematoma) by removing excessive ﬂuid and closing potential dead space to promote healing and prevent infection. This patient's incision is intact and there is no ﬂuctuance.

Answered correctly

(Choice D) If this patient develops signs of superﬁcial cellulitis (eg, erythema, increased

incisional induration), she may require oral antibiotic therapy. More severe wound infections (eg, necrotizing fasciitis) require broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and possible surgery

(eg, debridement). Educational objective:

clinically positive and biopsy-proven (eg, ﬁne-needle aspiration) nodes undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).

The spread of breast cancer to the axilla usually mirrors the course of the breast lymphatic drainage.The lymphatic drainage passes along the lateral edge of the pectoralis major muscle to reach lymph nodes lateral/inferior to the pectoralis minor muscle and/or posterior to the muscle. It then continues medially/superiorly to reach the infra- and supraclavicular lymph nodes, lymphatic ducts, and venous circulation. Therefore, the surgical classiﬁcation of the axillary lymph nodes, which corresponds to their likelihood of harboring tumor cells, uses the pectoralis minor muscle as its landmark:

A. Latissimus dorsi (10%)

• Level I: lateral/inferior to the pectoralis minor

• B. Pectoralis minor (73%).

• Level Il: posterior to the pectoralis minor

ALND typically resects only levels I and Il lymph nodes; this limits morbidity (eg, lymphedema) while providing an adequate sample for tumor staging by removing the lymph nodes most likely to be involved. If there is clear (ie, on palpation or imaging) involvement of the level Ill nodes, these may also be resected; however, level Ill involvement is associated with a poorer prognosis because they are the ﬁnal group in the lymphatic chain prior to drainage into the systemic circulation.

version

(Choices A, C, D, and E) The latissimus dorsi, subscapularis, and teres minor muscles form the posterior boundary of the axilla. The subclavius muscle, together with the pectoralis major and minor muscles, forms the anterior boundary of the axilla. Although these muscles help deﬁne the posterior- and anterior-most extent of the ALND, they do not distinguish between the surgical levels (ie, levels I, Il, and III) of the axillary lymph nodes.

Educational objective:

Lymphatic drainage from the breast passes primarily to the axillary lymph nodes, with drainage traveling from lateral to medial, posterior to the pectoralis minor muscle. The pectoralis minor muscle is the landmark for distinguishing the surgical levels of axillary lymph nodes during axillary lymph node dissection.

A 52-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce for follow-up a week after undergoing right breast partial mastectomy and right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy. She was recently diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma after mammography detected a hyperdense lesion in the right breast. Vital signs are normal. The right breast and axilla have mild, but appropriate, swelling; incisions are clean and intact, without erythema. Surgical pathology reveals completely excised invasive ductal carcinoma; ductal carcinoma in situ is present at the specimen's lateral margin. The tumor is estrogen receptor-, progesterone receptor-, and HER2-negative. The axillary sentinel lymph node is negative for metastasis. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient's breast cancer?

Explanation

Breast conserving therapy (BCT) is an alternative to mastectomy for many patients with early stage, unifocal breast cancer. BCT typically begins with partial mastectomy (aka, lumpectomy) to excise all invasive and/or in situ cancer (eg, ductal carcinoma in situ), along with axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy. The specimen, consisting of the removed tumor and a border of surrounding tissue (ie, margins), is examined under the microscope. Surgical pathology then determines the next steps:

A. Aromatase inhibitor therapy (8%)

B. MRI of the breast (2%)

C. Observation and repeat mammography in 6 months (23%)

D. Reexcision of the lateral margin (47%)

• Partial mastectomy: positive margins (eg, ductal carcinoma in situ at the lateral margin in this patient) require reexcision of the involved margins. In contrast, negative margins indicate that local tumor resection from the breast is complete.

• Sentinel lymph node biopsy: positive sentinel lymph nodes may warrant axillary lymph node dissection (typically performed for ≥3 positive nodes). In contrast, negative lymph nodes indicate that lymph node resection is complete.

• E. Right modiﬁed radical mastectomy (18%)

Following surgical therapy, radiation therapy is performed to eradicate any remaining tumor deposits and reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence. It is initiated only after negative surgical margins are obtained because positive margins double the rate of local recurrence. Reexcision is required to achieve negative margins in up to 25% of patients treated with BCT, and multiple reexcision attempts may be performed before resorting to completion mastectomy.

Version

(Choice A) Aromatase inhibitors (eg, anastrozole) reduce the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens, thereby decreasing plasma estrogen levels and potential estrogen stimulation of any residual hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. They would not be helpful in this patient with a hormone receptor-negative tumor.

(Choice B) Breast MRI is most often used when mammography and ultrasound are

inconclusive in the workup of a breast mass and is sometimes used for screening patients at

highest risk for breast cancer (eg, BRCA mutation). This patient has no such indication. In addition, MRI is unlikely to detect her residual disease, which may be microscopic.

(Choice C) This patient's surgical specimen has a positive margin; therefore, reexcision (rather than observation) should be performed to decrease the risk of future recurrence. Callawing DAT mammarronhu chould he encumad ot la.

(Choice E) Modiﬁed radical mastectomy includes mastectomy (removal of the entire breast and nipple areolar complex) and axillary lymph node dissection.Although this patient has residual disease and needs additional surgery, reexcision is a typical next step and is less morbid than mastectomy. In addition, lymph node dissection is not warranted in this patient with a negative axillary sentinel lymph node.

Educational objective:

Breast conserving therapy typically consists of partial mastectomy and axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by whole breast radiation therapy. Adequate surgical excision of the cancer requires negative margins.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

In general, ruptured ovarian cysts are benign and cause minimal lower abdominal pain. However, in patients on anticoagulation (as in this patient being treated for deep vein thrombosis), cyst rupture can cause signiﬁcant intraabdominal bleeding (ie, hemoperitoneum). Patients classically have unilateral lower abdominal pain that becomes increasingly diffuse, often radiating to the shoulder (due to phrenic nerve irritation). As blood ﬁlls the abdominal cavity, patients also develop peritoneal signs (eg, rigidity, rebound, guarding) and hemodynamic instability (eg, hypotension, tachycardia).

Diagnosis can be conﬁrmed by pelvic ultrasound, which typically reveals heterogeneous pelvic free ﬂuid and a possible ovarian cyst (if not completely drained). Patients with peritoneal signs and hemodynamic instability require emergency surgery (eg, diagnostic laparoscopy).

(Choice A) Acute appendicitis can cause right lower quadrant pain, possibly with rebound and rigidity (if the appendix is perforated); however, patients typically have fever and leukocytosis, which are not seen in this patient.

(Choice B) Acute mesenteric ischemia occurs due to inadequate intestinal perfusion (eg, thromboembolism of the superior mesenteric artery). However, pain is classically out of proportion to the examination (ie, no peritoneal signs). Shoulder pain (indicates abdominal free ﬂuid) would not be present.

• A. Acute appendicitis (5%).

• B. Acute mesenteric ischemia (6%)

• C. Ovarian torsion (14%).

D. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy (7%)

(Choice C) Ovarian torsion, which can occur with an ovarian cyst, typically presents with acute lower abdominal pain. However, it does not typically cause hemoperitoneum (eg, hypotension, acute blood loss anemia). Shoulder pain is not seen.

(Choice D) Ruptured ectopic pregnancy can present with hemoperitoneum; however, this patient has a negative quantitative B-hCG level, making this diagnosis unlikely.

(Choice F) Splenic rupture may cause hemoperitoneum but is typically associated with blunt abdominal trauma. In addition, pain initially begins in the left upper quadrant rather than the right lower quadrant.

Recurrent pneumonia in an elderly patient with dysphagia and regurgitation of undigested food raises strong suspicion for a Zenker diverticulum (ZD), a pouch posterior to the esophagus that forms due to herniation of the esophageal mucosa through an area of muscle weakness. presents with an insidious onset of progressive dysphagia. Trapping of food in the pouch can lead to halitosis. Patients often regurgitate the undigested food or medications several hours after eating, which can lead to aspiration and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The pouch occasionally becomes so large that it is palpable, as in this patient.

LULS Version

A swallow study with contrast esophagography conﬁrms the diagnosis. In this study, serial x-rays are taken of the esophagus after the patient has ingested a radiopaque contrast solution. In ZD, contrast is retained in the pouch. Despite the risk of pneumonitis due to aspiration of contrast, it remains the test of choice for diagnosing ZD because it is the only study that provides information regarding both the anatomy of the pouch (eg, size) and the functional impact of the diverticulum (eg, aspiration, esophageal obstruction).

(Choice A) Bronchoscopy is generally indicated if there is concern for an obstructing mass that could cause recurrent pneumonia in the same anatomic location. Even then, CT scan of the chest is the preferred initial study.

(Choice C) Placement of a gastric feeding tube would be premature in this patient because surgical treatment of ZD will likely improve the aspiration.

(Choice D) A neck mass in an adult is often suspicious for head and neck cancer. However, such masses are typically ﬁrm, whereas in the context of regurgitation of undigested food, a ﬂuctuant mass is likely a very large ZD. Biopsy could therefore lead to esophageal perforation.

(Choice E) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is not as sensitive as esophagography for detecting ZD because the openings of small diverticula may not be visible.Esophagography also yields more information about the functional impact of the diverticulum. Furthermore, endoscopy can be confusing or even risky if the cannula inadvertently enters the diverticulum during the procedure.

Educational objective:

Recurrent pneumonia in an elderly patient with dysphagia and regurgitation of undigested food raises concern for a Zenker diverticulum, which may occasionally present with a palpable mass. A swallow study with contrast esophagography can be used to conﬁrm the diagnosis.

A 4-month-old boy is brought to the ofﬁce due to occasional episodes of vomiting and irritability over several weeks. The vomitus occasionally resembles formula but is often green. The patient is irritable both before and after vomiting, typically refuses to feed, and often cannot be consoled. His mother has tried various formulas, without success, to improve the symptoms. The patient was born at 39 weeks gestation via cesarean delivery. An omphalocele diagnosed during the prenatal period was surgically repaired at birth without complications. Vital signs are normal.

Rectal examination shows normal, brown stool that is negative for fecal occult blood. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?

This patient has bilious emesis, a symptom highly worrisome for intestinal obstruction (eg, intussusception, malrotation). His history of omphalocele, or failed reduction of physiologic bowel herniation in utero, makes intestinal malrotation the most likely cause. This abnormality in fetal gut rotation is usually present to some degree in patients with omphalocele because these two embryologic events occur at a similar gestational age, but malrotation may not be identiﬁed until the patient is symptomatic. Malrotation is also associated with other congenital anomalies, such as diaphragmatic hernia and heterotaxy syndrome.

Malrotation may remain asymptomatic or cause acute or chronic symptoms. Symptomatic malrotation occurs with the following:

• A. Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (10%)

• B. Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (2%)

• C. Hypertrophy of the pylorus (11%).

D. Immature lower esophageal sphincter (19%)

• Midgut volvulus (ie, intestinal torsion), a life-threatening complication, usually presents in neonates with acute bilious emesis and abdominal distension. However, intermittent volvulus, which is likely the diagnosis in this patient, can cause chronic symptoms of episodic, often bilious, vomiting and abdominal pain, which may manifest as irritability and inconsolability in infants.

E. Malrotation of the intestines (55%)

• Duodenal obstruction is caused by Ladd bands, ﬁbrous, peritoneal tissues that cross the duodenum and attach the cecum to the abdominal wall. Complete duodenal obstruction typically presents acutely in newborns, whereas partial obstruction can present later with chronic vomiting (bilious or nonbilious), feeding refusal, and failure to thrive.

A high degree of clinical suspicion is required because examination between episodes may be unremarkable. Diagnosis is conﬁrmed using upper gastrointestinal series, and treatment is surgical (Ladd procedure) to divide the peritoneal bands and reposition the bowel.

(Choice A) Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome is a non-lgE-mediated food allergy that typically presents in infancy with nonbilious, rather than bilious, emesis after ingestion of a trigger food (eg, cow's milk).

(Choice B) Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease), a rare diagnosis in infants, can cause episodic gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea) after gluten ingestion. Vomiting can occur but would be nonbilious. Moreover, formula does not contain gluten. (Choice C) Pyloric stenosis classically presents at age 3-5 weeks with nonbilious projectile vomiting after every feeding attempt. This patient's age and intermittent bilious emesis make this diagnosis unlikely.

A 47-year-old man comes to the office due to bloating and abdominal discomfort for the past

Explanation

2 months. The patient's abdomen has become progressively enlarged in association with a 9-kg (19-lb) weight gain.He also notes fatigue and difﬁculty breathing while walking up and down steps but denies chest pain or palpitations. The patient drinks 8-10 beers a day but does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. He has no relevant medical history. Temperature is 37.5 C (99.5 F), blood pressure is 130/65 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical examination shows scleral icterus, palmar erythema, and multiple spider angiomas. The abdomen is distended and nontender, and a ﬂuid wave is present. A right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates a nodular, shrunken liver as well as the presence of ﬂuid in the intraperitoneal cavity. Diagnostic paracentesis reveals straw-yellow ﬂuid. Which of the following ﬂuid analysis tests should be performed?

A 47-year-old man comes to the office due to bloating and abdominal discomfort for the past

2 months. The patient's abdomen has become progressively enlarged in association with a 9-kg (19-lb) weight gain. He also notes fatigue and difﬁculty breathing while walking up and down steps but denies chest pain or palpitations. The patient drinks 8-10 beers a day but does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. He has no relevant medical history. Temperature is 37.5 C (99.5 F), blood pressure is 130/65 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical examination shows scleral icterus, palmar erythema, and multiple spider angiomas. The abdomen is distended and nontender, and a ﬂuid wave is present. A right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrates a nodular, shrunken liver as well as the presence of ﬂuid in the intraperitoneal cavity. Diagnostic paracentesis reveals straw-yellow ﬂuid. Which of the following ﬂuid analysis tests should be performed?

calculated by subtracting the peritoneal ﬂuid albumin concentration from the serum albumin concentration) are performed to conﬁrm the underlying etiology. Patients with cirrhosis typically have clear, yellow-tinged ascites with low protein (<2.5 g/dL) and a high SAAG (≥1.1 g/dL). Cell count and differential are also performed in all patients to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a life-threatening infection of the ascitic ﬂuid. Peritonitis symptoms usually include fever, abdominal pain, and mental status changes; however, ﬁndings may be subtle in early infection. The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by an absolute polymorphonuclear cell count ≥250/mm3. Further testing is based on clinical presentation and is not required in patients with a presentation suggestive of ascites from cirrhosis.

(Choice A) The ascites bilirubin level is elevated in the setting of a perforated biliary duct or bowel. Patients typically have brown (bilious) ascites, and present with sudden-onset, severe abdominal pain with peritoneal signs (eg, guarding).

• A. Bilirubin (3%)

• B. Cell count and differential (50%)

(Choice C) Cytology should be performed for patients in whom there is a concern for underlying malignancy-usually those with persistently bloody ascites and cachexia. Yellow ascitic ﬂuid is more suggestive of benign ascites from cirrhosis.

• C. Cytology (16%)

• D. Fluid pH (3%).

• E. Glucose (1%)

• F. Lactate dehydrogenase (23%)

(Choice D) Fluid pH is obtained when assessing pleural ﬂuid (ie, after a thoracentesis), and a low pH (<7.30) often indicates infection, malignancy, or rheumatoid effusion. pH does not have diagnostic value in a paracentesis.

A 51-year-old woman comes to the office to discuss colon cancer screening. She has

normal bowel movements and has had no hematochezia, melena, or unexpected weight loss. Medical history is signiﬁcant for hypertension. Her mother developed colon cancer at age 85. The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol. Vital signs are normal. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. The patient undergoes colonoscopy, during which two small (8 mm) hyperplastic polyps are found and removed. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

This patient has hyperplastic polyps, a non-neoplastic abnormality often found on screening colonoscopy. Hyperplastic polyps are most common in the rectosigmoid colon. Small (<1 cm) hyperplastic polyps do not increase the risk for colon cancer, and therefore patients may

continue colorectal screening at the usual intervals:

• Repeat colonoscopy in 10 years for individuals at otherwise average risk

• Repeat colonoscopy in 5 years for individuals with a high-risk family history (eg, ﬁrst-degree relative with colorectal cancer at age <60)

•

A. Colonoscopy in 1 year (26%)

• B. Colonoscopy in 10 years (67%)

• C. CT scan of the abdomen (0%),.

• D. Fecal occult blood testing in 6 months (2%)

• E. Mismatch repair genetic testing (1%)

Omitted

61/

Correct answer

This patient's mother was over age 60 at the time of diagnosis, which would not appreciably increase the patient's risk; a 10-year screening interval is appropriate.

(Choice A) More frequent screening (<10 years) is indicated for patients with adenomatous polyps, with the speciﬁc interval dependent on the size and number. Hyperplastic polyps do not change the normal screening frequency.

(Choice C) Abdominal CT scan is an appropriate staging measure for patients with a new diagnosis of colorectal cancer. It is not required in evaluation of either neoplastic (eg, adenoma) or non-neoplastic (eg, hyperplastic) polyps.

Answered correctly

02 secs

Time Spent

(Choice D) Periodic fecal occult blood testing is an appropriate screening modality for individuals at average risk for colorectal cancer. It is typically performed at 1-year (not 6month) intervals. This patient just had a colonoscopy with low-risk ﬁndings; additional screening tests will not be necessary for several years.

versioni

(Choice E) Mismatch repair genetic analysis can diagnose Lynch syndrome, which should be suspected in individuals with a strong family history (eg, ≥3 relatives involving multiple generations) of colon cancer, endometrial cancer, and/or ovarian cancer. This individual's family history is not extensive enough to warrant genetic testing.

Educational objective:

Hyperplastic polyps are a non-neoplastic abnormality commonly found on screening colonoscopy. Small hyperplastic polyps do not increase the risk for colon cancer, and patients

may continue colorectal screening at the usual intervals (eg, repeat colonoscopy in 10 years for individuals at otherwise average risk).

The patient describes occasional heavy alcohol use and drinks hard liquor daily. She does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 18/min. BMI is 24 kg/m?. No jaundice is present. Examination shows epigastric tenderness.Serum lipase levels are markedly elevated. Abdominal ultrasonogram reveals an enlarged pancreas, no gallstones, and normal gallbladder; a mass is also noted in the right lobe of the liver. Subsequent abdominal CT scan reveals a well-circumscribed, 5-cm mass with a central scar that appears hypodense on noncontrast imaging. Imaging with contrast indicates the lesion is hyperdense. The rest of the liver appears to be normal, and there is no intra- or extrahepatic duct dilatation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for the liver lesion?

• • A. Focal nodular hyperplasia (32%).

Most cases of FNH are asymptomatic and are discovered during abdominal imaging for other conditions. Lesions tend to be well-circumscribed, solitary, and <5 cm in size; they characteristically have a central, stellate scar, which surrounds a large congenital arterial anomaly that sends arterial branches to the periphery. Imaging with triphasic, helical CT scan (which evaluates the mass during different phases of vascular contrast) generally reveals a hyperdense lesion (ie, ﬁlled with contrast during hepatic arterial phase) and a central scar. Because FNH does not generally grow over time, undergo malignant transformation, or rupture, treatment is rarely required. Oral contraception is not believed to worsen FNH; therefore, contraception usually can be continued (in contrast to hepatic adenoma).

(Choices B and C) Surgical drainage is not usually required for diverticular abscess but is used for patients who do not improve with percutaneous drainage or have additional complications. Immediate surgery (eg, sigmoid bowel resection) is typically considered for patients with bowel obstruction or who have frank perforation with peritonitis.

Educational objective:

Potential complications of diverticulitis include abscess, perforation, obstruction, and ﬁstula formation. Small abscesses (<4 cm) often respond to intravenous antibiotics alone without drainage, but larger abscesses (24 cm) require drainage, usually via a percutaneous drain placed under CT or ultrasonography guidance.

Explanation

quadrant pain. Two years ago, he underwent an extensive small bowel resection for Crohn disease and has since been receiving total parenteral nutrition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography reveals several gallstones, which were not present on ultrasonography performed 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the gallstones?

This patient with prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has developed gallstones, most likely due to gallbladder stasis.

A. Estrogen-induced increase in cholesterol secretion

B. Gallbladder stasis

C. Hypertriglyceridemia

D. Increased enterohepatic recycling of bile acids

With normal enteral nutrition, the presence of proteins and fatty acids in the duodenum stimulates the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes gallbladder contraction. In patients receiving TPN, the normal stimulus for CCK release and gallbladder contraction is absent, leading to gallbladder stasis. Because the gallbladder actively absorbs water from bile, making the bile more concentrated, stasis can result in excessive dehydration of bile and formation of sludge and gallstones.

• E. Increased red blood cell destruction

Crohn disease and small bowel resection also increase this patient's risk for gallstones. Patients with a damaged or absent (ie, resected) ileum experience decreased bile acid reabsorption (ie, decreased enterohepatic recycling). Subsequent loss of bile acids into the feces results in an imbalance in the bile acid/cholesterol ratio within the bile. When bile becomes supersaturated with cholesterol, the risk of gallstone formation increases (Choice D).

(Choice A) Estrogen increases cholesterol production in the liver, which can lead to supersaturation of bile and precipitation of cholesterol gallstones. However, affected patients are primarily those who are pregnant or taking oral contraceptive pills or estrogen therapy. Progesterone levels can also affect gallstone risk; increased progesterone reduces bile acid secretion and slows gallbladder emptying, thus promoting cholesterol gallstone formation.

(Choice C) Hypertriglyceridemia can increase the risk for gallstone formation, but this typically occurs within the context of metabolic syndrome (eg, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus). Some patients receiving prolonged TPN may develop hypertriglyceridemia (especially if not monitored appropriately), but gallbladder stasis occurs whenever enteral intake is absent and is a more likely cause of gallstones in this case.

(Choice E) Increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction (eg, hemolytic anemia) creates an excess of bilirubin (a degradation product of heme), which is secreted into the bile and can result in formation of pigmented gallstones. This patient has no medical history to suggest RBC destruction and instead has another clear risk factor-gallbladder stasis in the setting of

prolonged TPN-for gallstone formation.

Physical examination shows mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography reveals several gallstones, which were not present on ultrasonography performed 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the gallstones?

Crohn disease and small bowel resection also increase this patient's risk for gallstones. Patients with a damaged or absent (ie, resected) ileum experience decreased bile acid reabsorption (ie, decreased enterohepatic recycling). Subsequent loss of bile acids into the feces results in an imbalance in the bile acid/cholesterol ratio within the bile. When bile becomes supersaturated with cholesterol, the risk of gallstone formation increases (Choice D).

(Choice A) Estrogen increases cholesterol production in the liver, which can lead to

A. Estrogen-induced increase in cholesterol secretion

B. Gallbladder stasis

C. Hypertriglyceridemia

D. Increased enterohepatic recycling of bile acids

supersaturation of bile and precipitation of cholesterol gallstones. However, affected patients are primarily those who are pregnant or taking oral contraceptive pills or estrogen therapy. Progesterone levels can also affect gallstone risk; increased progesterone reduces bile acid secretion and slows gallbladder emptying, thus promoting cholesterol gallstone formation.

• E. Increased red blood cell destruction

(Choice C) Hypertriglyceridemia can increase the risk for gallstone formation, but this typically occurs within the context of metabolic syndrome (eg, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus). Some patients receiving prolonged TPN may develop hypertriglyceridemia (especially if not monitored appropriately), but gallbladder stasis occurs whenever enteral intake is absent and is a more likely cause of gallstones in this case.

(Choice E) Increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction (eg, hemolytic anemia) creates an excess of bilirubin (a degradation product of heme), which is secreted into the bile and can result in formation of pigmented gallstones. This patient has no medical history to suggest RBC destruction and instead has another clear risk factor-gallbladder stasis in the setting of prolonged TPN-for gallstone formation.

Educational objective:

Patients receiving total parenteral nutrition lack the normal enteral stimulus for gallbladder contraction. This results in gallbladder stasis, which creates concentrated bile and promotes the formation of sludge and gallstones.

A 72-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to upper abdominal pain and weight loss. The abdominal pain is worse when eating food and is sometimes relieved with over-the-counter antacids. He has not had dysphagia, melena, or rectal bleeding. The patient has a history of hypertension, which is well controlled with chlorthalidone. He does not take other prescription or over-the-counter medications and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patient emigrated from South Korea 20 years ago. Temperature is 36.8 C (98.2 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respirations are 14/min.BMI is 17.2 kg/m?. Mucous membranes are dry. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Epigastric fullness and tenderness are present, but there is no hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral pulses are full and capillary reﬁll is normal. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

Explanation

This patient's weight loss, epigastric fullness, and abdominal pain relieved with antacids raise suspicion for gastric cancer. Incidence is particularly high in Eastern Asia (eg, South Korea), Eastern Europe, and the Andean part of South America where diets are rich in salt-preserved foods (damages stomach mucosa) and nitroso compounds (carcinogenic). Other risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, alcohol use, and atrophic gastritis.

• A. Carcinoembryonic antigen testing (0%)

• B. CT angiogram of the mesenteric vessels (1%)

• C. CT scan of the abdomen (14%)

Patients with gastric cancer usually develop persistent epigastric pain that often worsens with eating (due to the irritant effects of gastric acid on the tumor) and weight loss (due to insufﬁcient caloric intake). Proximal stomach tumors may also cause dysphagia and postprandial nausea and vomiting. The diagnosis is generally established using esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to visualize the stomach and obtain biopsy samples of suspicious lesions.

• • D. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (68%)

(Choice A) Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) may be elevated in some cases of gastric cancer, this test has low sensitivity and cannot be used to rule out or screen for a gastric tumor. CEA is used for follow-up (not screening or diagnosis) of colorectal cancer, which is unlikely to cause upper abdominal pain and is associated with rectal bleeding.

• E. Gastric emptying scan (0%)

• F. Helicobacter pylori stool antigen testing (14%)

(Choice B) CT angiogram of the mesenteric vessels can diagnose mesenteric ischemia, which often causes severe abdominal pain following eating (ie, "intestinal angina"). However, relief with antacids would be atypical, and most patients have risk factors (eg, smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus) for atherosclerotic disease.

Gastric cancer is endemic to Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Andean portions of South America due to diets high in salt-preserved food and nitroso compounds. Manifestations typically include weight loss and chronic mid-epigastric pain that worsens with eating. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is the initial test of choice to establish the diagnosis.

A 74-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to worsening lethargy and

Explanation

abdominal pain and distension. For the past several days, the patient has had watery diarrhea. However, in the last 24 hours, he has not had a bowel movement, and the abdominal pain and distension have worsened, with the patient becoming progressively more lethargic. Medical history is signiﬁcant for hypertension, myocardial infarction, atrial ﬁbrillation, and stroke with hemiplegia. He was recently hospitalized for treatment of an infected pressure ulcer. Temperature is 38.8 C (101.8 F), blood pressure is 106/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 118/min. On physical examination, the patient is ill appearing and somnolent. Mucous membranes are dry. The abdomen is distended and diffusely tender. Bowel sounds are decreased. Leukocyte count is 18,000/mm'. Serum potassium is 3.2 mEq/L. Abdominal x-ray is shown in the image below:

This patient's watery diarrhea, abdominal distension, leukocytosis, fever, and radiographic evidence of a markedly distended colon raise strong suspicion for toxic megacolon due to Clostridioides difﬁcile infection. Major risk factors for C difﬁcile include advanced age, recent hospitalization, and antibiotic use (eg, for infected pressure ulcers).

Most cases of C difﬁcile colitis are marked by watery diarrhea (23 in 24 hours), abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and nausea. A minority of patients develop severe complications such as toxic megacolon, which is characterized by nonobstructive colonic dilation. Toxic megacolon generally presents with the following:

• Severe systemic toxicity (eg, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, lethargy)

• Abdominal distension and pain (diarrhea may cease due to lack of colonic motility)

• Leukocytosis (usually >15,000/mm3)

• Radiographic evidence of large bowel dilation (eg, >6 cm [60 mm] in colon, >9 cm [90 mm] in cecum)

Treatment includes bowel rest, nasogastric tube placement, and aggressive antibiotic therapy against C difﬁcile. Any agent that contributes to a lack of gastrointestinal motility (eg, opiates, anticholinergics, antimotility medications) should be discontinued. Lack of response or clinical deterioration often necessitates further imaging (eg, CT scan of the abdomen) and, sometimes, surgical intervention (eg, colectomy).

(Choice A) C difﬁcile is largely noninvasive; pathology is mediated by the release of exotoxins (toxin A and toxin B) that cause inﬂammation and mucosal injury and lead to colonic ulceration. Although perforation can occur due to toxic megacolon, free air is usually seen on x-ray.

(Choice B) Hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness leading to ileus when it is severe (eg, <2.5-3.0 mEq/L). However, mild hypokalemia (eg, 3.0-3.4 mEq/L), as in this patient (likely from his initial diarrhea), does not usually produce skeletal or smooth muscle weakness.

This patient has developed ischemic hepatitis (shock liver) resulting from myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and cardiogenic shock. Ischemic hepatitis usually occurs in the setting of global hypoperfusion and/or hypoxemia; in addition to cardiac insults, other common causes include hypovolemic and septic shock as well as respiratory failure. Histologically, hepatocyte necrosis is found predominantly in zone 3 of the liver lobule, ie, surrounding the central veins where cells are farthest from the oxygen supply coming from the hepatic artery (~40% of the liver's oxygen supply) and the portal vein (~60% of the liver's oxygen supply as partially deoxygenated blood).

Patients often develop aminotransferase levels >1000 U/L shortly after the inciting incident. Although the bilirubin level can be unaffected, it usually rises several days later. Prognosis is poor as patients are typically critically ill and often have accompanying multiorgan failure. In those who survive, the hepatic injury tends to be self-limited; aminotransferase elevations usually resolve within 7 days, and bilirubin levels normalize over the course of several weeks.

B. Acute viral hepatitis (2%)

C. Hepatocyte ischemia (55%)

A 62-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past 2 days.She has eaten nothing unusual, and no one else at her home is sick. The patient has no diarrhea, dysuria, or urinary frequency.

Medical conditions include type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 18/min.Oxygen saturation shows 94% on room air. BMI is 32 kg/m?. On physical examination, the patient is awake and alert but appears unwell. The oropharynx has dry mucous membranes. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal lung and heart sounds. The abdomen is mildly distended. There is marked tenderness over the epigastrium and right upper quadrant with guarding. Bowel sounds are decreased. The extremities have no cyanosis or edema.

This patient has emphysematous cholecystitis characterized by fever, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, and gas within the gallbladder wall. Unlike uncomplicated acute cholecystitis, emphysematous cholecystitis is a surgical emergency that warrants immediate intervention to prevent progression to gallbladder perforation and septic shock. The treatment of choice is emergency cholecystectomy, along with broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, piperacillintazobactam) and bile culture.

Abdominal ultrasonography reveals thickening of the gallbladder wall, pericholecystic ﬂuid, and multiple hyperechoic calculi. Air is noted within the gallbladder wall, and the common bile duct is not dilated. Intravenous ﬂuids, insulin, analgesics, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Which of the following additional interventions is most appropriate in the management of this patient?

• A. Delayed cholecystectomy before hospital discharge (12%)

• B. Elective cholecystectomy 2 weeks after complete recovery (8%)

Risk factors for emphysematous cholecystitis include relative immunosuppression (eg, age >50, diabetes mellitus) and conditions that diminish gallbladder perfusion (eg, atherosclerosis compromising cystic artery blood supply). Damaged or ischemic gallbladder tissue becomes a nidus for gas-forming bacteria (eg, Clostridium, some Escherichia coli strains) to proliferate. Gas formed within the gallbladder wall may then leak into the gallbladder lumen and biliary tree (pneumobilia), or into the adjacent abdominal wall (occasionally detected as RUQ crepitus).

Emphysematous cholecystitis

• Diabetes mellitus

Risk factors

• Vascular compromise

• Immunosuppression

Clinical • Fever, right upper quadrant pain, nausea/vomiting presentation • Crepitus in abdominal wall adjacent to gallbladder

Abdominal ultrasonography reveals thickening of the gallbladder wall, pericholecystic ﬂuid, and multiple hyperchoic calculi. Air is noted within the gallbladder wall, and the common bile duct is not dilated. Intravenous ﬂuids, insulin, analgesics, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Which of the following additional interventions is most appropriate in the management of this patient?

• Air-ﬂuid levels in gallbladder, gas in gallbladder wall Diagnosis • Cultures with gas-forming Clostridioides, Escherichia coli

• Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, mildly elevated aminotransferases

• Emergency cholecystectomy

Treatment

• A. Delayed cholecystectomy before hospital discharge (12%)

• B. Elective cholecystectomy 2 weeks after complete recovery (8%)

• Broad-spectrum antibiotics with Clostridioides coverage (eg, piperacillin-tazobactam)

C. Emergency cholecystectomy (68%)

• D. Emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (4%)

E. Emergency percutaneous gallbladder drainage (6%)

This patient has emphysematous cholecystitis characterized by fever, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, and gas within the gallbladder wall. Unlike uncomplicated acute cholecystitis, emphysematous cholecystitis is a surgical emergency that warrants immediate intervention to prevent progression to gallbladder perforation and septic shock. The treatment of choice is emergency cholecystectomy, along with broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, piperacillintazobactam) and bile culture.

Risk factors for emphysematous cholecystitis include relative immunosuppression (eg, age >50, diabetes mellitus) and conditions that diminish gallbladder perfusion (eg, atherosclerosis compromising cystic artery blood supply). Damaged or ischemic gallbladder tissue becomes a nidus for gas-forming bacteria (eg, Clostridium, some Escherichia coli strains) to proliferate. Gas formed within the gallbladder wall may then leak into the gallbladder lumen and biliary tree (pneumobilia), or into the adjacent abdominal wall (occasionally detected as RUQ crepitus).

Typical laboratory ﬁndings include leukocytosis with left shift and small elevations in aminolansterases.In clostridial infection, exotoxin release can cause hemolysis, resulting in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Although ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice in most forms of cholecystitis, it is less sensitive for emphysematous cholecystitis; because of the modality's poor visualization of air-ﬁlled structures, extensive gas in the gallbladder wall may be falsely identiﬁed as air in the bowels. Abdominal CT scan is often required to conﬁrm the diagnosis.

(Choice A) Cholecystectomy before discharge, ideally within 72 hours, is the standard of care for low-risk patients with acute nonemphysematous cholecystitis. Emphysematous cholecystitis requires emergency cholecystectomy due to high risk for morbidity and mortality.

Abdominal ultrasonography reveals thickening of the gallbladder wall, pericholecystic ﬂuid, and multiple hyperechoic calculi. Air is noted within the gallbladder wall, and the common bile duct is not dilated. Intravenous ﬂuids, insulin, analgesics, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Which of the following additional interventions is most appropriate in the management of this patient?

(Choices B and E) Cholecystectomy may be delayed until after recovery in patients with acutely unstable medical conditions (eg, unstable angina) causing a very high perioperative risk of mortality; in such cases, initial treatment typically involves intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous gallbladder drainage (cholecystostomy). This patient is hemodynamically stable without acutely unstable comorbidities; therefore, deﬁnitive cholecystectomy can be performed immediately.

IBD patients are at the highest risk of developing TM early in the disease, usually within 3 years of diagnosis and sometimes at initial presentation. Mucosal inﬂammation from IBD likely causes pathologic colonic dilation through an inﬂammatory mediator-induced increase in nitric oxide production (which causes smooth muscle dilation) and/or extension of the mucosal inﬂammation into the smooth muscle layer (which causes muscle paralysis and subsequent colonic dilation).

Ei em

Intravenous corticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone) are ﬁrst-line therapy for IBD-induced TM because of their potent anti-inﬂammatory effect. Other management includes supportive care (eg, intravenous ﬂuids, electrolyte repletion), bowel rest and decompression (eg, nasogastric tube), and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Nonoperative management is often successful; however, surgical intervention (eg, subtotal colectomy with end-ileostomy) may be required if symptoms fail to improve.

• A. Colonoscopy (35%).

B. Intravenous ganciclovir (6%)

C. Intravenous methylprednisolone (41%)

D. Pain control with intravenous opioids (15%)

(Choice A) Colonoscopy (typically with biopsy) is often used in the workup of IBD to distinguish between ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. However, colonoscopy is avoided in TM because air insufﬂation and instrumentation within the inﬂamed, dilated colon carries a high risk of perforation.

(Choice B) Ganciclovir is used to treat cytomegalovirus colitis, which can progress to TM in immunocompromised patients (eg, HIV, organ transplant). However, cytomegalovirus-induced colitis is exceedingly rare in an immunocompetent patient.

An 18-year-old football player is brought to the emergency department due to persistent pain following a hard tackle. The patient had just caught a pass when he was tackled from the front, with the opponent landing all his weight on the patient's abdomen.Immediately afterward, he began to experience abdominal discomfort and nausea. Blood pressure is 92/64 mm Hg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 24/min.The patient is alert but appears anxious. Bilateral breath sounds are clear and equal. Heart sounds are normal without murmur. The abdomen is mildly distended and tender to palpation diffusely.Chest x-ray and pelvic x-ray are normal. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma reveals intraperitoneal free ﬂuid. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to reveal which of

the following?

Explanation

This patient with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) now has a distended and diffusely tender abdomen, intraperitoneal free ﬂuid on Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST), and signs of hypovolemic shock (eg, tachycardia, hypotension). This presentation is concerning for intraabdominal hemorrhage, most likely due to splenic laceration.

The spleen is one of the most frequently injured organs in BAT, with the spectrum of injury ranging from contusion or subcapsular hematoma to laceration with life-threatening, intraperitoneal bleeding (due to the spleen's high vascularity). Management depends on the patient's hemodynamic status following resuscitation.

• A. Abdominal aortic tear (4%).

B. Bladder rupture (4%)

• C. Diaphragmatic tear (0%)

• D. Duodenal hematoma (7%)

• E. Pancreatic transection (4%)

In patients who are hemodynamically stable enough to undergo further imaging, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast is ideal for visualizing the extent of injury and diagnosing ongoing bleeding (eg, contrast extravasation). Often, blunt splenic injury can be managed nonoperatively (eg, observation with serial hemoglobin measurement, embolization). However, continued hemodynamic instability (eg, despite initial resuscitation) or frank peritonitis are indications for exploratory laparotomy and potential splenectomy.

Correct answer

(Choice A) Abdominal aortic injuries due to BAT are rare (<1%). Many patients with traumatic aortic injury die from exsanguination before reaching the hospital. Those who survive (because bleeding has been contained within the retroperitoneum) typically would not have a large amount of intraperitoneal free ﬂuid on FAST.

(Choice C) Diaphragmatic tearing can occur from BAT due to a sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure.

(Choices D and E) Rapid compression of the upper abdomen against the vertebral column can crush the duodenum or pancreas, potentially causing duodenal hematoma or pancreatic transection. However, duodenal hematoma does not cause intraperitoneal free ﬂuid because bleeding remains conﬁned within the duodenal wall. Likewise, pancreatic transection does not cause an acute effusion of intraperitoneal ﬂuid; even with leakage of pancreatic juice (ie, ductal injury), formation of a large, ultrasound-detectable peripancreatic ﬂuid collection (eg, pseudocyst) typically takes days to weeks.

An 82-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to fever and confusion. Yesterday, he experienced abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and rigors in the nursing home where he lives. Earlier today, he was found to be lethargic. Medical history includes hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer dementia. The patient quit smoking 30 years ago and does not drink alcohol. Temperature is 39.1 C (102.4 F), blood pressure is 105/55 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min. He is lethargic but arousable to strong stimuli. On examination, the mucous membranes are dry. Scleral icterus is present. No cardiac murmurs are heard. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium but no distension, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results are as follows:

Explanation

This patient's presentation suggests gallstone pancreatitis complicated by acute cholangitis. Gallstone pancreatitis develops when a gallstone passes through the biliary tree and obstructs the ampulla or ﬂow from the pancreatic duct, allowing bile to reﬂux into the pancreas. In addition to the classic manifestations of pancreatitis (eg, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, elevated serum lipase or amylase), patients with obstruction of the ampulla may also demonstrate cholestatic liver function studies (eg, elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, transaminases).

If the stone remains in the biliary tract, the resultant bile stasis can allow bacteria to ascend from the duodenum, leading to acute cholangitis. In addition to cholestatic liver function studies (due to stasis and obstruction), the presence of Charcot triad (right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, fevers) suggests the diagnosis, and altered mental status and hypotension (ie, Reynolds pentad) indicate particularly severe disease. Common bile duct dilation (as seen in this patient) or choledocholithiasis on a right upper quadrant ultrasound further support the diagnosis.

Eosinophils Lymphocytes

Management includes aggressive intravenous hydration and antibiotics. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is indicated to relieve the biliary obstruction, during which a sphincterotomy, stone extraction, and/or biliary stent placement can be

performed.

The gallbladder wall is not thickened. In addition to aggressive intravenous hydration and antibiotics, which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

(Choice A) Although a CT scan can help diagnose pancreatitis, the combination of acute abdominal pain and elevated serum lipase is sufﬁcient for diagnosis. In addition, a CT scan is less sensitive than an ultrasound for detecting changes associated with cholangitis (eg, common bile duct dilation) and may miss gallstones, which are frequently radiolucent.

(Choices B and D) A HIDA scan is used to diagnose cholecystitis in patients with equivocal

ultrasound ﬁndings; however, in addition to fevers and right upper quadrant pain, cholecystitis results in gallbladder wall thickening and edema visible on ultrasound, whereas biliary dilation suggests cholangitis. An elective cholecystectomy to prevent further complications of gallstone disease should be deferred until after the current complications have resolved.

In addition to the classic manifestations of pancreatitis (eg, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, elevated serum lipase or amylase), patients with obstruction of the ampulla may also demonstrate cholestatic liver function studies (eg, elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, transaminases).

If the stone remains in the biliary tract, the resultant bile stasis can allow bacteria to ascend from the duodenum, leading to acute cholangitis.

(Choice A) Although a CT scan can help diagnose pancreatitis, the combination of acute abdominal pain and elevated serum lipase is sufﬁcient for diagnosis. In addition, a CT scan is less sensitive than an ultrasound for detecting changes associated with cholangitis (eg, common bile duct dilation) and may miss gallstones, which are frequently radiolucent.

Acute cholangitis should be suspected in a patient with gallstone pancreatitis who also has fevers, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, altered mental status, and hypotension. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is required to relieve the biliary obstruction and prevent serious infectious complications.

Ileus is a functional defect in bowel motility without an associated physical obstruction. Manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, failure to pass ﬂatus or stool (obstipation), and hypoactive bowel sounds. Some degree of ileus occurs following most abdominal procedures; however, persistence of the signs and symptoms (>3-5 days postoperatively) is termed prolonged (or "pathologic") postoperative ileus (PPI).

Version

Contributors to PPI include increased splanchnic nerve sympathetic tone following peritoneal instrumentation, local release of inﬂammatory mediators, and postoperative opiate analgesic use (which causes decreased gastrointestinal motility and disordered peristalsis). Techniques to prevent PPI include epidural anesthesia, minimally invasive surgery, and judicious perioperative use of intravenous ﬂuids (to minimize gastrointestinal edema). Diagnosis is clinical, although abdominal x-rays revealing dilated loops of bowel with no transition point support the diagnosis.

Adhesions, which begin to form immediately following abdominal surgeries, are the most common cause of mechanical bowel obstruction (MBO) in the United States. Manifestations of MBO are similar to those of PPI. However, MBO typically causes hyperactive (not hypoactive)

Adhesions, which begin to form immediately following abdominal surgeries, are the most common cause of mechanical bowel obstruction (MBO) in the United States. Manifestations of MBO are similar to those of PPI. However, MBO typically causes hyperactive (not hypoactive) bowel sounds. In addition, patients with postoperative MBO often have a temporary return of bowel function prior to symptom onset (unlike this patient). As with PPI, x-rays reveal dilated loops of bowel; however, compared to PPI, X-rays in MBO are more likely to reveal air-ﬂuid levels and a clear transition point (Choice F).

(Choice A) Following cholecystectomy, bile is secreted into the duodenum via the intact common bile duct and then stored in the upper small intestine during fasting. Occasionally, postcholecystectomy diarrhea can occur due to bile acid malabsorption.

• E. Perioperative antibiotics (0%)

• F. Postoperative adhesions (4%)

(Choice B) Gallstone ileus occurs when a gallstone passes through a biliary-enteric ﬁstula into the small bowel causing signs and symptoms of MBO. As the stone advances, it can cause intermittent "tumbling" obstruction until ﬁnally lodging in the ileum. Diagnosis is typically made preoperatively.

This patient has acute chest pain and pleural effusion within hours after endoscopy, most concerning for esophageal perforation (EP). Endoscopy is the most common cause of EP, with adjunctive procedures (eg, biopsy, stricture dilation) further increasing risk. Patients with EP commonly have severe chest pain and/or back pain due to the esophagus's posterior location. Associated clinical ﬁndings are due to outﬂow of esophageal air (eg, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax) or ﬂuid (eg, pleural effusion) into the surrounding tissues and the resulting inﬂammatory response (eg, tachycardia, tachypnea).

Esophagography with water-soluble contrast-which can visualize contrast extravasating through the perforation-is the best initial study to conﬁrm EP. Barium contrast is more sensitive but can incite a granulomatous inﬂammatory response; it is only used when initial esophagography is nondiagnostic. Because EP is a life-threatening condition that can rapidly progress to mediastinitis and septic shock, emergent surgical consultation is indicated. Most perforations reauire operative debridement and repair.

(Choice B) Pancreatitis, which increases serum amylase and/or lipase, can present with severe pain and an exudative pleural effusion (usually left-sided). However, it typically causes epigastric rather than chest pain; although it can develop postprocedurally, it classically follows endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (due to instrumentation and dye injection involving the pancreatic duct) not upper endoscopy (which does not reach the pancreatic duct). (Choice C) Elevated amylase in the pleural ﬂuid (due to leaked saliva) could increase suspicion for EP. However, compared to contrast esophagography, pleural ﬂuid analysis has less speciﬁcity for the diagnosis (eg, pancreatitis-associated effusion also has elevated amylase) and is unable to localize the tear in preparation for likely surgery.

(Choice D) Severe substernal pain raises concern for a cardiac etiology (eg, myocardial ischemia, pericarditis), which transthoracic echocardiography can help evaluate. However, the absence of concerning ECG ﬁndings (eg, ST changes) and this patient's lack of cardiac risk factors make EP a more likely cause of this patient's substernal pain, especially in the setting of recent endoscopy.

Educational objective:

Esophageal perforation is a life-threatening complication of endoscopy. Clinical presentation may include severe chest/back pain, systemic inﬂammatory response, and pleural effusion from leaked esophageal contents. Contrast esophagography is the best test to conﬁrm the diagnosis.

Initial evaluation showed no signiﬁcant trauma or rib fracture, but the chest x-ray revealed an air/ﬂuid level posterior to the caralac silnouele consistent with a silding nialal nernia. Ine pallent teels well and has had no heartburn, regurgitation, difﬁculty swallowing, or abdominal discomfort. He has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this

patient?

Explanation

This patient has an asymptomatic sliding hiatal hernia. The distal esophagus is attached circumferentially to the diaphragm at the esophageal hiatus by the phrenoesophageal membrane. Sliding hiatal hernias occur due to laxity of this membrane, typically in the setting of age-related degeneration or repetitive stress (eg, vomiting, coughing). This allows the gastroesophageal junction and proximal stomach to slide into the thoracic cavity.

• B. Esophageal manometry (1%)

• C. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (6%)

Most sliding hiatal hernias are discovered incidentally during imaging performed for other reasons. Plain radiography typically reveals a retrocardiac opacity (often with an air/ﬂuid level) within the thoracic cavity. Although sliding hiatal hernias predispose patients to developing gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD) (eg, heartburn, dysphagia, chest pain), asymptomatic patients require no further evaluation beyond observation. Patients with reﬂux symptoms should be medically managed (eg, proton pump inhibitors). Those with refractory GERD symptoms can be considered for antireﬂux surgery (eg, Nissen fundoplication) (Choice

She has not had a bowel movement during this period but is passing ﬂatus.Medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Bowel sounds are normoactive in all quadrants. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Dipstick urinalysis is positive for leukocyte esterase and negative for nitrite. Which of the following is the most likely

diagnosis?

This patient's left lower abdominal pain and tenderness, vomiting, anorexia (decreased appetite), and low-grade fever likely indicate acute diverticulitis, a complication of diverticulosis.Diverticulosis is characterized by herniation of the colonic mucosa and submucosa through the circular and longitudinal muscle layer due to elevated intraluminal pressure. Risk increases with age and is greatest in those with obesity, poor diet (eg, low ﬁber, high red meat), and tobacco use. Although diverticulosis is usually asymptomatic, approximately 5%-15% of patients develop diverticular bleeding or diverticulitis.

In diverticulitis, alterations in the mucosal barrier function of the diverticular wall lead to microperforation or macroperforation and subsequent colonic wall inﬂammation. Most cases arise in the sigmoid colon, the site of the greatest intraluminal pressure, and present with the

following:

• Left lower quadrant abdominal pain

• Nausea and vomiting

• Alteration in bowel habits (eg, constipation, diarrhea)

A. Acute bacterial cystitis (25%)

B. Acute diverticulitis (59%)

C. Ovarian torsion (5%)

D. Ruptured ovarian cyst (4%)

E. Small bowel obstruction (4%)

In addition to intestinal symptoms, mild irritative urinary symptoms (eg, urgency, frequency) and sterile pyuria (eg, positive leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite) are common in acute diverticulitis due to irritation of the bladder from the adjacent inﬂamed sigmoid colon. This patient's left lower, rather than suprapubic, abdominal pain and tenderness are more consistent with diverticulitis than with acute cystitis (Choice A).

(Choice D) Ruptured ovarian cysts most often present with severe, sudden-onset abdominal pain, often following strenuous physical activity (eg, sexual intercourse, exercise). The majority of cases occur in female patients of reproductive age. Slowly progressive pain lasting 2 days is not common.

(Choice E) Small bowel obstruction is most often caused by postoperative adhesions related to previous abdominal or pelvic surgery. Although nausea/vomiting and low-grade fever can occur, patients typically have paroxysms of crampy periumbilical pain (not dull, persistent, left lower quadrant pain) and often cannot pass ﬂatus. In addition, high-pitched bowel sounds are often present.

following:

A 56-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce due to abdominal pain and nausea. The patient has had 2 days of dull, persistent pain in the left lower abdomen that has progressively worsened. She has lost her appetite and vomited once today. In addition, the patient has had mild urinary urgency with no dysuria or hematuria. She has not had a bowel movement during this period but is passing ﬂatus. Medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 134/82 mm Hg, and pulse is 94/min. BMI is 33 kg/m?. Physical examination shows left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness with no rebound tenderness or guarding. No palpable abdominal mass or organomegaly is present. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all quadrants. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Dipstick urinalysis is positive for leukocyte esterase and negative for nitrite. Which of the following is the most likely

diagnosis?

• Left lower quadrant abdominal pain

• Nausea and vomiting

• Alteration in bowel habits (eg, constipation, diarrhea)

In addition to intestinal symptoms, mild irritative urinary symptoms (eg, urgency, frequency) and sterile pyuria (eg, positive leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite) are common in acute diverticulitis due to irritation of the bladder from the adjacent inﬂamed sigmoid colon. This patient's left lower, rather than suprapubic, abdominal pain and tenderness are more consistent with diverticulitis than with acute cystitis (Choice A).

(Choice C) Ovarian torsion usually causes pelvic pain, nausea/vomiting, and, occasionally, fever. However, the pain is often acute and severe, and most patients have a palpable adnexal mass.

A. Acute bacterial cystitis (25%)

B. Acute diverticulitis (59%)

C. Ovarian torsion (5%)

D. Ruptured ovarian cyst (4%)

E. Small bowel obstruction (4%)

(Choice D) Ruptured ovarian cysts most often present with severe, sudden-onset abdominal pain, often following strenuous physical activity (eg, sexual intercourse, exercise). The majority of cases occur in female patients of reproductive age. Slowly progressive pain lasting 2 days is nol cormitorI.

A 19-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to a change in bowel habits. Six months ago, the patient began having loose, watery stools with increased frequency to approximately 5 times daily. In addition, he has had crampy, intermittent abdominal pain that usually improves after defecation. No nausea, vomiting, melena, fevers, night sweats, or weight loss has occurred. The patient vacationed in South America 12 months ago. He does not use tobacco or alcohol. Temperature is 37.4 C (99.3 F), blood pressure is 138/87 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient appears comfortable and is not in acute distress. There is no conjunctival pallor, scleral icterus, or palpable lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. The abdomen is nontender and nondistended. Rectal examination reveals scant blood in the stool but no hemorrhoids or ﬁssures. Laboratory results are as follows:

CD is characterized grossly by a cobblestone appearance, skip lesions (eg, areas of normalappearing bowel between inﬂamed segments), and deep serpiginous ulcers. On the other hand, UC demonstrates continuous, shallow ulcerations and pseudopolyps. On histology, chronic inﬂammation in CD extends beyond the submucosa and is often transmural; noncaseating granulomas may be present. In UC, inﬂammation is usually limited to the mucosa, although it occasionally extends into the submucosa.

Immunologic and rheumatologic studies

C-reactive protein12.1 mg/L (<3 mg/L)

(Choice A) Fecal calprotectin, a stool marker for inﬂammatory diarrhea, is typically elevated in patients with IBD. However, it is not speciﬁc for IBD and is not used to make the initial diagnosis of IBD; it is sometimes used in patients with established CD who have symptoms of a ﬂare. An elevated fecal calprotectin would not distinguish between CD and UC.

Stool studies are negative for ova and parasites as well as Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

• A. Check fecal calprotectin (11%).

(Choices B and G) Tissue transglutaminase is a marker of celiac disease, whereas loperamide and the low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, And Polyols) diet represent initial steps in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Neither celiac disease nor IBS presents with an elevated C-reactive protein or bloody stool on rectal examination.

B. Check serum tissue transglutaminase (15%)

• C. Obtain a barium enema (1%).

• D. Obtain a colonoscopy (55%),

• E. Obtain a CT of the abdomen and pelvis (4%)

• F. Prescribe a course of azithromycin (1%)

(Choice C) A barium enema can be used to characterize colonic inﬂammation; however, it is less accurate than a colonoscopy for diagnosing IBD.

(Choice E) CT ﬁndings (eg, fat stranding, intestinal wall thickening) in IBD are identical to those of other types of colitis (eg, infectious, ischemic) and are therefore too nonspeciﬁc to be used for initial diagnosis.

G. Recommend loperamide and a low FODMAP diet (9%)

(Choice F) Azithromycin is used to treat travelers' diarrhea, which causes abdominal cramps and self-limited watery or bloody diarrhea. This patient's travel history is too remote to be related to his clinical presentation; travelers' diarrhea typically presents within 2 weeks of initial

infection.

Metastatic disease is the most common cause of liver mass and is much more common than primary liver cancer. Undiagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) is likely in this patient with a solitary liver mass, probable iron deﬁciency anemia (low mean corpuscular volume), and positive fecal occult blood screen. Gastrointestinal malignancies, such as colorectal or pancreatic cancer, are the most frequent source of liver metastases as their venous drainage is through the portal system directly to the liver. Lung, breast, and skin cancers (melanoma) often also spread to the liver. The liver is a common site of metastatic disease due to its dual blood supply (systemic and portal) and hepatic sinusoidal fenestrations allowing for easier metastatic deposition.

A. Angiosarcoma of the liver (6%)

B. Cholangiocarcinoma (10%)

Liver metastases are often clinically silent unless pressure on the liver capsule or obstruction of the biliary tree causes pain or jaundice. Results of hepatobiliary laboratory testing (eg, alkaline phosphatase) may be normal or mildly elevated, even in the setting of heavy tumor burden. Multiple hepatic nodules are typically seen in metastatic disease; however, solitary lesions are not uncommon. If a primary tumor is identiﬁed (eg, with colonoscopy), liver biopsy is usually

not needed.

A 67-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to abdominal discomfort and distension. Five days ago, he began having large-volume watery stools 6-8 times daily after eating at a new restaurant. He also has had associated mild abdominal cramps and nausea but no fever, chills, vomiting, or bloody stools. His wife, who had the same food, also experienced similar symptoms. He self-treated with increased oral ﬂuids and the stool frequency and consistency began to improve. However, his bowel movements abruptly stopped yesterday, and the diffuse abdominal discomfort and distension worsened. Medical history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure treated with diuretics. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 116/72 mm Hg, and pulse is 102/min. Physical examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is distended, tympanic, and mildly tender to palpation with no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are decreased. Digital rectal examination reveals an empty rectal vault with no evidence of blood or melena. Abdominal CT scan shows diffuse colonic dilation with nondilated small bowels. Leukocyte count is normal and testing for Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile is negative. Which of the following most likely contributed to this patient's current condition?

The disorder may largely result from autonomic disruption of the colon. Accordingly, other common causes include severe trauma, severe infection, or major surgery (increased sympathetic drive relative to parasympathetic); neurologic disorders (eg, dementia, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease); and certain medications (eg, anticholinergics).

A 67-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to abdominal discomfort and distension. Five days ago, he began having large-volume watery stools 6-8 times daily after eating at a new restaurant. He also has had associated mild abdominal cramps and nausea but no fever, chills, vomiting, or bloody stools. His wife, who had the same food, also experienced similar symptoms. He self-treated with increased oral ﬂuids and the stool frequency and consistency began to improve. However, his bowel movements abruptly stopped yesterday, and the diffuse abdominal discomfort and distension worsened. Medical history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure treated with diuretics. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 116/72 mm Hg, and pulse is 102/min. Physical examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is distended, tympanic, and mildly tender to palpation with no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are decreased. Digital rectal examination reveals an empty rectal vault with no evidence of blood or melena. Abdominal CT scan shows diffuse colonic dilation with nondilated small bowels. Leukocyte count is normal and testing for Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile is negative. Which of the following most likely contributed to this patient's current condition?

Management involves bowel rest (NPO) and placement of nasogastric and rectal tubes for colonic decompression. Neostigmine can be given intravenously if symptoms fail to improve after 48 hours or if the cecal diameter on imaging exceeds 12 cm (which is a strong predictor of impending perforation).

(Choice A) An endoluminal mass can lead to mechanical colonic obstruction; however, symptoms of obstipation and abdominal distension tend to develop less abruptly than in Ogilvie syndrome. In addition, this patient's CT scan would likely demonstrate a mass if it were large enough to cause obstruction.

(Choice B) Colonic hypoperfusion leads to ischemic colitis, which usually presents with hematochezia and abdominal pain; colonic dilation is not typical.

(Choices D and E) Entamoeba histolytica infection presents with hematochezia and liver abscesses and is rarely acquired within the United States. Ulcerative colitis tends to cause hematochezia, abdominal pain, and weight loss.Both E histolytica and ulcerative colitis can precipitate toxic megacolon, but one would expect signs of sepsis (eg, fever, leukocytosis) in addition to colonic dilation if this were present.

Educational objective:

Acute colonic pseudoobstruction (Ogilvie syndrome) typically presents with severe abdominal distension, pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Common causes include electrolyte imbalance (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) and factors that lead to autonomic disruption of the colon (eg, major surgery, neurologic disease, anticholinergic medication). The diagnosis is made by CT scan showing colonic dilation without anatomic obstruction, and treatment involves bowel rest and colonic decompression, sometimes aided by intravenous neostigmine.

Chemotherapy +/- Palliative surgery

©uWorld For adenocarcinoma of the stomach, treatment options and prognosis are determined primarily by the disease stage at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of the affected tissues is the mainstay of therapy; therefore, early detection of gastric cancer improves the chances of successful management. However, almost 90% of patients with gastric cancer are diagnosed at advanced stages (III-IV), at which point radical resection is very complicated or impossible. For this reason, evaluation of the extent of the cancer is the most important objective following initial histologic diagnosis.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is commonly employed for disease staging and is sensitive for revealing metastases (especially in the liver). Depending on CT ﬁndings, additional stading procedures such as lanaroscony endosconic ultrasound chest CI

V • A. CT scan (56%)

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is commonly employed for disease staging and is sensitive for revealing metastases (especially in the liver). Depending on CT ﬁndings, additional staging procedures, such as laparoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, chest CT, or positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) may be necessary (Choice D). Patients diagnosed with limited-stage disease may be considered for curative resection, but those with more advanced disease staging are generally referred for palliative interventions.

B. Exploratory laparotomy (4%)

C. Helicobacter pylori eradication (31%)

• D. Laparoscopy (4%)

• E. Serologic markers (2%)

(Choice B) Laparotomy is eventually required for curative or palliative management in most patients, but initial CT imaging is needed to plan the appropriate next steps in evaluation. (Choice C) Helicobacter pylori infection is a signiﬁcant risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma and lymphoma (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] lymphoma). Eradication is recommended for patients with documented H pylori infection who have resectable disease to reduce the risk of developing a second cancer. Eradication of H pylori causes remission in some patients with gastric MALT lymphoma but is not curative for adenocarcinoma. Empiric eradication (without testing) is not recommended.

(Choice E) A number of serologic markers have been proposed for use in gastric cancer staging, including carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen (CA) 125. These tumor markers are often elevated in patients with advanced disease, but studies have not found them to have any signiﬁcant clinical utility and they are typically not routinely obtained prior to

surgery.

Educational objective:

In gastric adenocarcinoma, tumor stage at the time of diagnosis determines prognosis and treatment options. A CT scan is the initial staging modality.

A 56-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce for evaluation of diarrhea. He has had 6 or 7 loose, watery brown stools every day for the past 4 weeks as well as frequent nocturnal episodes while sleeping. The patient has no fever, hematochezia, melena, unexpected weight loss, or abdominal pain. He was discharged from the hospital 5 weeks ago after a protracted stay for emphysematous cholecystitis complicated by intraabdominal abscess, which required an emergency cholecystectomy and abscess drainage as well as broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Medical history is signiﬁcant for morbid obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. There has been no change in the patient's home medications.

Bile acid diarrhea is a common complication of cholecystectomy and occurs due to the overly rapid release of bile into the intestines, where it overwhelms the resorptive capacity of the terminal ileum and spills into the colon, resulting in secretory (fasting) diarrhea. Bile-acid binding resins (eg, cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam) are ﬁrst-line therapy.

• Oral antibiotics (eg, rifaximin, ciproﬂoxacin, doxycycline) This patient likely has small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), characterized by the proliferation of colonic or oral bacteria in the small bowel.

Normally, bacterial growth in the small intestine is inhibited by gastric acid and pancreaticobiliary juices, intestinal peristalsis, and immunoglobulins in intestinal secretions. The ileocecal valve also serves as a physical barrier, preventing colonic bacteria from entering the small intestine. Therefore, SIBO can develop in the setting of motility disorders or following ileocecal resection, as in this patient. Clinical features include bloating, ﬂatulence, abdominal discomfort, and watery diarrhea; in severe cases, malabsorption may be seen. Laboratory studies are frequently normal but may demonstrate nutritional deﬁciencies (eg, vitamin B12, fat-soluble vitamins) and macrocytic anemia.

Normally, colonic bacteria ferment any nonabsorbed substrate after 2-3 hours; in contrast, an earlier rise in breath hydrogen (at <1.5 hours) suggests fermentation in the small bowel, indicating SIBO.

• A. Capsule endoscopy (18%).

B. Carbohydrate breath testing (37%)

(Choice A) Video capsule endoscopy (swallowing a capsule with a camera to visualize the gastrointestinal tract) is most often used to evaluate small bowel hemorrhage, which is unlikely in the absence of hematochezia or iron deﬁciency anemia. This study is typically preceded by upper and lower endoscopy. In addition, this patient's prior bowel resection increases the risk for capsule retention, which could require endoscopic or surgical retrieval.

(Choice C) Fecal elastase, a highly sensitive and speciﬁc indirect test for pancreatic function, is low in patients with chronic pancreatitis. This diagnosis is unlikely without speciﬁc risk factors (eg, smoking, alcohol use, recurrent acute pancreatitis), and there is no association between chronic pancreatitis and ileocecal resection.

(Choice E) Celiac disease can cause diarrhea and bloating and can be diagnosed by duodenal biopsy. However, this patient's anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody levels are normal, making celiac disease less likely, and his surgical history increases risk of SIBO.

Educational objective:

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can develop after ileocecal resection due to colonic bacteria entering the small intestine. The gold standard for diagnosis is jejunal aspirate with a quantitative culture of intestinal ﬂuid; however, this test is invasive. Instead, SIBO can be conﬁrmed with a carbohydrate breath test.

A 56-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit due to septic shock from pneumonia and is treated with intravenous ﬂuids, antibiotics, and vasopressors. Four days later, the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory status has improved, but he has worsening anemia with positive stool occult blood. He has had no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, diarrhea, or hematochezia. Medical history includes hypertension but no prior gastrointestinal disorders. The patient is a smoker with a 40-pack-year history. Medications are intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 110/66 mm Hg, and pulse is 84/min. Physical examination reveals right lung crackles and no abdominal tenderness. Hemoglobin is 10.2 g/dL (12.6 g/dL at admission), platelets are 180,000/mm', and leukocytes are 12,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's anemia?

Explanation

This patient who developed occult gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage days after being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for septic shock likely has a stress-induced ulcer.

Stress ulcerations are exceedingly common in patients requiring ICU-level care, and typically develop within hours to days of severe physiologic stress. Risk factors include shock, sepsis, coagulopathy, mechanical ventilation, traumatic spinal cord/brain injury, burns, and high-dose corticosteroids. The etiology is multifactorial and likely includes splanchnic hypoperfusion, reﬂux of bile salts, and accumulation of uremic toxins that impair formation of the protective mucosal layer around the stomach, allowing for mucosal injury and bleeding.

• A. Acute colonic ischemia (22%)

• B. Acute infectious colitis (5%)

• C. Diverticular bleeding (11%)

• Omitted Correct answer

D. Peptic ulcer disease (2%)

E. Stress-induced ulcer (57%)

57%

Stress ulcers typically form in the proximal stomach and duodenum and may result in generally painless GI bleeding, which can be occult (eg, anemia, positive fecal occult blood testing) or clinically obvious (eg, melena, hematemesis) with shock. Prophylactic acid suppressive agents (eg, proton pump inhibitors [PP|s], H2 blockers) are a mainstay in the prevention of stress ulcerations. However, they are typically reserved for high-risk patients (eg, bleeding diathesis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, recent Gl bleed) due to the potential harms associated with these agents, including pneumonia and Clostridiodes (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile infection. Patients who develop ulcerations should receive PP|s and close monitoring; endoscopy may be required in those with clinically signiﬁcant bleeding.

(Choice A) Acute colonic ischemia is due to hypoperfusion and usually affects watershed areas (limited collateral ﬂow) in the left colon (eg, splenic ﬂexure, rectosigmoid junction). Therefore, it typically presents with crampy, left-sided abdominal pain and overt hematochezia during or shortly after (<24 hours) episodes of hypotension.

Explanation

This patient's presentation is concerning for a postbariatric surgery anastomotic leak. Following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, this complication can occur due to breakdown of either the gastrojejunal or jejunojejunal surgical anastomosis, leading to leakage of gastrointestinal contents into the peritoneum. The leak usually develops within the ﬁrst week after surgery and can include fever, abdominal pain, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Heart rate > 120/min has been shown to be the most sensitive predictor of postoperative anastomotic leak.

Patients with a suspected anastomotic leak should undergo an oral contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan or upper gastrointestinal series, followed by urgent surgical repair if a leak is demonstrated. Because an anastomotic leak is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, urgent surgery is still recommended if the index of suspicion is high enough, even if imaging is nondiagnostic.

(Choice B) Pulmonary embolism is common after surgery, and CT angiogram of the chest is the diagnostic test of choice. Although a pulmonary embolism can present with fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia, severe abdominal pain is unlikely.

(Choice C) An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) can evaluate for a marginal ulcer (ulceration at the gastrojejunal anastomosis), which usually presents several months to years after surgery with nausea, abdominal pain, or evidence of bleeding (eg, melena, anemia). However, EGD is contraindicated if an anastomotic leak is suspected as it can worsen the leak and cause frank perforation.

• B. CT angiogram of the chest (4%)

• C. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (18%).

(Choice D) A HIDA scan is used to diagnose cholecystitis by demonstrating cystic duct obstruction. Although gastric bypass patients are at increased risk for developing gallstones months to years after surgery, gallstone disease is unlikely in the immediate postoperative period. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is typically the initial test to evaluate for gallstone

disease.

D. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan (2%)

• E. Reassurance and symptomatic management (6%)

• F. Stool analysis for Clostridioides difﬁcile toxin (3%)

(Choice E) Reassurance and symptomatic (eg, pain) management is not appropriate because an unrecognized anastomotic leak will likely progress to peritonitis and overwhelming sepsis.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's condition?

• • A. Congenital vascular malformation (51%)

Vascular rings encompass congenital malformations of the aortic arch system that encircle the trachea and/or esophagus and cause compressive symptoms. Tracheal compression leads to biphasic stridor that increases with increased work of breathing (eg, crying, feeding).

Vascular rings can also present with esophageal compression symptoms, as in this patient with severe solid-food dysphagia. She was gaining weight well as an infant likely due to being on an all-liquid diet (requiring less esophagus distension). With the introduction of solid foods (around age 6 months), dysphagia became more pronounced and the patient's growth rate slowed due to increasing reliance on solid foods for her caloric needs. She had recurrent food impactions at the site of esophageal compression, seen on ﬂuoroscopic esophagography at around the level of the aortic arch (eg, T3-T4). Her episodes of middle-lobe pneumonia were possibly due to aspiration.

CT scan can delineate the anatomy forming the vascular ring and evaluate associated tracheal abnormalities. Due to possible concurrent cardiac and airway abnormalities, patients require direct laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and echocardiogram. Treatment is surgical division of the structures creating the ring.

• C. Esophageal ganglionic degeneration (26%).

(Choice B) Eosinophilic esophagitis can cause dysphagia to solids, repeated food impactions and, potentially, normal esophagoscopy (although mucosa biopsy would show eosinophils). However, posterior esophageal compression is not seen.

D. Foreign body ingestion (1%)

E. Fungal infection of the esophagus (0%)

• F. Malignant proliferation of mucous gland tissue (3%)

Omitted

(Choice C) Primary achalasia is characterized by inﬂammatory degeneration of esophageal neurons, leading to impaired peristalsis and incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. It can cause regurgitation of undigested food and heartburn. However, dysphagia is typically to both solids and liquids, and esophagography shows esophageal dilation with a "bird-beak" appearance.

A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for rectal pain that started 2 hours ago.The pain is described as severe, burning, and exacerbated while sitting. Medical history is signiﬁcant for chronic idiopathic constipation, for which she takes a ﬁber supplement. The patient has 4 children, all of whom were vaginally delivered. Family history is unremarkable.She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 37.2 (99 F), blood pressure is 138/84 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min. On physical

as either internal (proximal) or external (distal). Risk factors include constipation, abnormal defecation (eg, straining, prolonged sitting on the toilet), increasing age, and pregnancy. Thrombosis typically occurs with external hemorrhoids and manifests as excruciating anorectal pain exacerbated by sitting. Direct visualization of a bluish (or purplish) bulge at the anal verge conﬁrms the diagnosis. Anoscopy can make visualization easier and is useful if the diagnosis is in doubt. Initial management of thrombosed hemorrhoids includes sitz baths, stool softeners, and topical anesthetics (eg, lidocaine). External hemorrhoidectomy is needed for severe cases that fail to respond to conservative measures.

(Choice A) Condyloma acuminata (anogenital warts) present as ﬂeshy, cauliﬂower-shaped masses. They are more common in individuals who engage in anal intercourse. Symptoms include itching, scant bleeding, and impaired anal hygiene.

• A. Condyloma acuminata (0%)

• B. Crohn disease (0%)

• C. Perianal abscess (1%)

• D. Prolapsed internal hemorrhoid (6%)

• E. Rectal prolapse (1%).

• F. Thrombosed external hemorrhoid (90%)

Omitted

(Choices B and C) Perianal abscesses, which can occur with Crohn disease, present as tenderness and swelling with erythema and induration of the overlying skin. The onset is more subacute than a thrombosed hemorrhoid, and fever is common.Other perianal manifestations of Crohn disease include ﬁstulae, which present with malodorous, purulent fecal drainage as well as pain and itchiness. The external opening of a ﬁstula should be apparent on examination.

(Choice D) Although internal hemorrhoids can thrombose, associated pain is typically mild or absent because they are less innervated than external hemorrhoids. Prolapsed internal hemorrhoids appear as pink or purple masses protruding through the anal verge; they may or may not be reducible.

(Choice E) Rectal prolapse is common in older women with multiple vaginal deliveries. Examination demonstrates an erythematous mass with concentric rings that prolapses through the anus with Valsalva. Patients typically experience incomplete bowel evacuation and anorectal mass sensation; severe pain is unexpected.

A 27-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain radiates to her back and is exacerbated by eating. The patient was recently diagnosed with functional biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction for which she underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy 24 hours ago. She has no other chronic medical conditions. She does not drink alcohol. Temperature is 38.7 C (101.7 F), blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 19/min. There is no scleral icterus. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is tender to palpation in the epigastrium, soft, and without rebound or guarding. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a minimally invasive

endoscopic technique used to visualize and intervene upon the biliary and pancreatic ducts, is widely used for stone removal, tissue sampling, stent placement, and sphincterotomy. In some patients, ERCP with manometry can conﬁrm the diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD), which typically causes biliary-type pain with no obvious etiology. Post-ERCP complications can occur; postprocedural abdominal pain is relatively common and may be due to infection (eg, ascending cholangitis), perforation, or pancreatitis.

• A. CT scan of the abdomen (15%).

• B. HIDA scan (2%)

• C. MR cholangiopancreatography (4%)

• D. Right upper quadrant ultrasound (13%)

The most common complication is post-ERCP pancreatitis, which occurs in up to 10% of patients and is particularly prevalent in those with SOD. Classic symptoms of pancreatitis include nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain that radiates to the back and worsens with eating. Fever may occur due to inﬂammation. Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed in patients meeting ≥2 of the following criteria:

• Severe epigastric pain (often radiating to the back)

• Amylase or lipase ≥3 times the upper limit of normal

• • E. Serum lipase (63%)

• Characteristic ﬁndings of acute pancreatitis on imaging (eg, CT, MRI, ultrasound) Because the ﬁrst 2 criteria are sufﬁcient to conﬁrm the diagnosis, serum amylase and lipase should be obtained as part of the initial workup in all patients with suspected pancreatitis. These enzymes rise within several hours of the development of symptoms whereas CT ﬁndings may remain normal for up to 48 hours.

(Choice A) CT scan of the abdomen is the most sensitive method for diagnosing perforation (eg, bowel wall, pancreatic/biliary duct), and it demonstrates intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal free air. Signiﬁcant perforations can cause abdominal pain and fever; however, abdominal distension, rigidity, rebound, and guarding would be expected. CT scan is less useful in the evaluation of post-ERCP pancreatitis as ﬁndings may initially be normal.

(Choices B and D) A HIDA scan is used to diagnose acute cholecystitis by demonstrating cystic duct obstruction whereas a right upper quadrant ultrasound may be used to identify cholecystitis or biliary dilation due to cholangitis. These complications can cause fever, nausea, and vomiting, but pain is typically located in the right upper quadrant. In addition,

This patient who received aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation for trauma and severe burns now has a tensely distended abdomen and evidence of intraabdominal organ dysfunction (ie, renal dysfunction with decreasing urine output). This presentation is most concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and should prompt measurement of bladder pressure, which estimates intraabdominal pressure (IAP).

Patients receiving massive ﬂuid resuscitation are at increased risk for ACS, especially when coupled with conditions (eg, trauma, burns) that cause a systemic inﬂammatory response, increased capillary permeability, and third spacing of ﬂuids (including into the abdominal cavity). The resulting increase in IAP may decrease perfusion to intraabdominal organs (ie, abdominal perfusion pressure = mean arterial pressure - IAP). resultina in oraan dvsfunction.

abdominal perfusion pressure = mean arterial pressure - IAP), resulting in organ dysfunction. Increased IAP also causes diaphragmatic elevation and extrinsic compression of the lung, leading to high pressures during ventilation (eg, peak inspiratory pressures).

Measurement of bladder pressure, via a foley catheter attached to a pressure transducer, is the standard method to estimate IAP. If ACS is present (eg, IAP >25 mm Hg), surgical decompression of the abdomen (ie, laparotomy without fascial closure, allowing for an open abdomen) may be necessary.

(Choice A) Bilateral chest tubes may be indicated to treat pleural collections of air or ﬂuid, which can compress the lung and increase inspiratory pressures. However, they are not indicated in this patient with a normal lung examination and chest x-ray. This patient's difﬁculty with ventilation is likely due to extrinsic lung compression from increased IAP and diaphragmatic elevation.

(Choice B) Intravenous mannitol, an osmotic diuretic agent, is sometimes used in the management of increased intracranial pressure to decrease cerebral edema. However, diuretics are not typically used in management of ACS and may cause intravascular volume depletion that further decreases intraabdominal organ perfusion.

(Choices D and E) A 3-story fall may cause blunt chest trauma and blunt cardiac injury, with the potential for myocardial dysfunction (which transesophageal echocardiography can evaluate) or cardiac tamponade (which may require pericardiocentesis). Myocardial dysfunction and cardiac tamponade can both cause cardiogenic shock, impaired renal perfusion, and decreased urine output; however, they are unlikely given this patient's normal blood pressure, lack of pulmonary edema, and normal heart sounds (vs new murmur or distant heart sounds).

A 65-year-old man is being evaluated in the hospital due to altered mental status and fever. He was admitted 10 days ago for acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol use.On admission, the patient was afebrile, and CT scan revealed pancreatic edema and necrosis. He has been receiving intravenous ﬂuids and intravenous opioid pain control since then. Today, the patient appears confused and requests more pain medication.Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 90/64 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 22/min. The pupils are 2 mm and symmetric, and the neck is supple. The lungs are clear to auscultation, and heart sounds are normal. Bowel sounds are decreased, but the abdomen is nondistended; there is tenderness to palpation in the epigastrium. The ﬂanks are tympanic to percussion, without any ﬂuid wave. Neurologic examination shows no focal ﬁndings. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

Explanation

This patient with signs of sepsis (eg, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, confusion) 10 days after being admitted with acute necrotizing pancreatitis has likely developed infected pancreatic

necrosis.

Acute necrotizing pancreatitis is thought to occur when pancreatic inﬂammation (ie, pancreatitis) causes uncontrolled release of pancreatic enzymes, leading to autodigestion of the pancreatic parenchyma and peripancreatic tissues (eg, pancreatic edema and necrosis on CT). Initially, the resulting necrotic collection is sterile; however, infection with enteric pathogens (eg, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus) occurs in approximately a third of patients, typically 7-10 days after onset of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.

• A. Administration of naloxone (9%)

B. CT scan of the abdomen (67%)

C. CT scan of the head (1%)

D. Intravenous lorazepam (9%)

E. Lumbar puncture (1%)

• F. Serum ammonia level (10%)

When this occurs, patients can decompensate clinically (eg, fever, confusion, sepsis), and a CT scan of the abdomen should be ordered (even if an initial CT scan was obtained). Gas (produced by microorganisms) within the necrotic collection on CT scan is diagnostic for infected pancreatic necrosis and prompts initiation of intravenous antibiotic therapy. If CT ﬁndings are equivocal, aspiration and culture of the necrotic pancreatic material may be necessary to conﬁrm the diagnosis. Débridement (eg, endoscopic, surgical) is often required but is ideally delayed until the patient has stabilized on antibiotic therapy and the necrotic collection has become encapsulated (ie, walled off), which facilitates débridement.

The patient has a 15- to 30-pack-year smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally. Physical examination shows mild epigastric tenderness to palpation. The lungs are clear to auscultation.There are no murmurs on cardiac examination. She has tender, erythematous, and palpable cord-like veins on the left arm and upper chest. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this

patient?

Explanation

This patient's presentation suggests migratory superﬁcial thrombophlebitis, classically known as Trousseau syndrome. Trousseau syndrome is a hypercoagulable disorder that usually presents with unexplained superﬁcial venous thrombosis at unusual sites (eg, arm, chest area). The syndrome is usually diagnosed prior to (sometimes months to years before) or at the same time as an occult visceral malignancy.

• A. Antibiotics and reassurance (7%)

B. Barium swallow (5%)

C. Colonoscopy (2%)

D. CT scan of the abdomen (64%)

Trousseau syndrome is usually associated with cancer involving the pancreas (most common), lung, prostate, stomach, and colon, and acute leukemias. Factors associated with higher risk of pancreatic cancer include increasing age and smoking. The tumor likely releases mucins that react with platelets to form platelet-rich microthrombi. This patient with a history of heavy smoking, abdominal pain, and migratory thrombophlebitis should be referred for CT scan of the abdomen to evaluate for an occult tumor (eg, pancreatic carcinoma).

• E. D-dimer testing (13%)

• F. Echocardiogram (5%)

(Choice A) Peripheral septic thrombophlebitis is most often associated with breaks in the skin due to catheters, venipuncture, or intravenous injections. Patients often present with fever and pain with swelling at the infection site. However, this patient's absence of fever or history of catheterization or injection makes this less likely.

(Choice B) Barium swallow is useful for evaluating esophageal abnormalities (eg, dysphagia, odynophagia) or documenting aspiration. However, it is not as useful for evaluating suspected pancreauc or gastic cancer.

Version

(Choice C) Trousseau syndrome is much more commonly associated with pancreatic rather than colon cancer. Colonoscopy is indicated for patients with anemia and positive fecal occult blood tests. It may be required in this patient if initial abdominal CT does not reveal a pancreatic tumor.

(Choice E) D-dimer testing is useful in low-risk patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. However, results may be elevated and less useful in patients with signs of migratory superﬁcial thrombophlebitis and suspected malignancy.

(Choice F) This patient's chest pain is most likely due to superﬁcial thrombophlebitis. She has no signs or symptoms of heart failure or valvular disease (eg, shortness of breath, peripheral edema, murmurs on physical examination) and does not require an echocardiogram

This older woman has a protruding rectal mass that increases in size with the Valsalva maneuver; the most likely diagnosis is rectal prolapse (RP). RP causes the rectum to protrude out the anus and is often related to defects in the pelvic ﬂoor or rectal tissue fascia. It is most common in women age >40; risk factors include multiparity, vaginal delivery, and

chronic constipation or straining.

RP causes fecal incontinence, constipation, and abdominal discomfort. An erythematous mass with concentric rings that protrudes out the anus and increases in size with intraabdominal pressure (eg, Valsalva maneuver) is a typical ﬁnding for full-thickness prolapse; radial invaginations are seen in non-full-thickness prolapse.

Explanation

and moaning in bed at his nursing care facility. For 2 days prior, he refused to eat most of his food. Medical history is signiﬁcant for early Alzheimer disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bilateral knee replacement, and right hemicolectomy for stage I colon cancer. The patient has a 50-pack-year smoking history but no longer smokes or drinks alcohol.Temperature is 38.7 C (101.7 F), blood pressure is 102/54 mm Hg, pulse is 114/min, and respirations are 22/min. The patient is holding his abdomen and groaning.

He opens his eyes to a loud voice but does not follow commands. The abdomen is distended, tympanitic to percussion, and rigid to palpation. Stool guaiac test is negative. The patient cannot tolerate sitting upright. Lateral decubitus x-ray of the abdomen is shown

This patient with abdominal pain, fever, and peritonitis (eg, abdominal rigidity) has subdiaphragmatic free air on lateral decubitus x-ray, indicating perforated viscus. Given his history of hemicolectomy, the most likely cause of perforation is postoperative adhesions leading to bowel obstruction (eg, anorexia, x-ray ﬁndings of dilated small-bowel loops with airﬂuid levels) complicated by increased intraluminal pressure.

Clinical suspicion of gastrointestinal perforation can be conﬁrmed by demonstration of intraperitoneal free air (ie, pneumoperitoneum) on imaging. Plain radiographs often conﬁrm the diagnosis (sensitivity ~50%-70%). Upright radiographs of the chest and abdomen are usually performed, but supine and lateral decubitus x-rays can be obtained for patients, such as this one, who cannot tolerate being upright. Free air on x-ray and clinical signs of peritonitis should prompt emergent surgical exploration to prevent deterioration and possible death.

In patients in whom perforation is suspected and plain radiographs are negative (unlike this patient), CT scan of the abdomen with IV contrast can help detect smaller amounts of free air or free ﬂuid. In this patient with peritonitis and an x-ray conﬁrming perforation, operative intervention should be immediately initiated (if operating availability is delayed, it would be reasonable to perform a CT scan to try to visualize the site of perforation) (Choice C).

(Choices A and F) Barium enema and upper gastrointestinal series use contrast to outline the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract for diagnosis of functional or structural abnormalities (eg, obstructing mass). However, barium contrast is contraindicated if perforation is suspected because it incites a severe inﬂammatory response if leaked into the peritoneal cavity. In addition, emergent surgical exploration should not be delayed for further imaging because of the patient's peritonitis and radiographic conﬁrmation of perforation.

(Choice B) This patient has risk factors (eg, hyperlipidemia, 50-pack-year smoking history) for chronic mesenteric ischemia (which can be evaluated by contrast angiography), but this type of ischemia typically causes recurrent episodes of postprandial pain, which are not seen in this patient.

A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to postprandial abdominal pain and bilious emesis. He has never had similar symptoms and has no other medical conditions. Two days ago, the patient stopped his bicycle abruptly and slammed into the handlebar. He immediately experienced abdominal pain, which improved over the next several hours. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness without rigidity or rebound tenderness.Bowel sounds are normal. Bedside ultrasonography reveals no intraperitoneal free ﬂuid. Plain abdominal radiograph shows gastric dilation with scant distal gas. Laboratory results are as follows:

Hemoglobin 13.8 g/dL Leukocytes 8000/mm3 Total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL Amylase 91 U/L

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

•• A. Duodenal hematoma (82%)

Explanation

This patient with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) has a delayed presentation of postprandial abdominal pain with signs of proximal small-bowel obstruction (eg, bilious emesis, gastric dilation with scant distal gas), ﬁndings concerning for duodenal hematoma (DH).

Rapid compression of the duodenum (eg, handlebar impact) against the vertebral column during BAT can injure blood vessels between the submucosal and muscularis layers, causing

bleeding and hematoma formation. As the hematoma progressively expands over the

subsequent 24-48 hours, partial or complete obstruction of the duodenal lumen can develop. As a result, patients typically have a delayed presentation with suggestive symptoms (eg, epigastric pain, bilious emesis) and radiographic ﬁndings (eg, gastric dilation with scant distal gas). Children typically have less protective abdominal walls (eg, thinner musculature, less adipose tissue) and are therefore more vulnerable to developing DHs from

BAT.

B. Liver laceration (4%)

C. Pancreatic pseudocyst (7%)

D. Pyloric stenosis (3%)

• E. Small-bowel perforation (2%)

CT imaging of the abdomen can conﬁrm the diagnosis. DHs are typically managed with bowel rest, nasogastric decompression, and parenteral nutrition. The majority resolve with nonoperative management, but percutaneous drainage or surgery may be considered for DHs that persist beyond a few weeks.

(Choice B) Liver laceration is one of the most common complications of BAT but typically results in abnormal vital signs (eg, tachycardia), right upper quadrant tenderness, and intraperitoneal free ﬂuid (blood). This patient's slightly elevated bilirubin is likely due to hematoma resorption (eg, hemoglobin breakdown to bilirubin).

(Choice C) Pancreatic injury may result from BAT rapidly compressing the pancreas against the vertebral column. Resulting pancreatic leakage may form a pseudocyst, with the possible symptoms of emesis and epigastric tenderness. However, pseudocysts typically develop over weeks rather than 2 days.

Version

(Choice D) Pyloric stenosis can cause emesis and gastric dilation; however, emesis is nonbilious because the obstruction is at the gastric outlet, proximal to the ampulla of Vater (ie, bile inﬂow). In addition, pyloric stenosis typically presents within the ﬁrst 2 months of life and would be extremely rare in a child age 10.

A 50-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to 2 months of progressive generalized weakness, anorexia, and abdominal distension. He has also had bilateral lower extremity swelling. The patient has a history of alcohol use disorder and liver cirrhosis, which was diagnosed 5 years ago. His last right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed 18 months ago; it showed surface nodularity and increased liver echogenicity but no free ﬂuid in the abdomen. He has no other chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. Temperature is 37.3 C (99.1 F), blood pressure is 103/76 mm Hg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 14/min. Pulse oximetry shows 96% on room air. The patient is awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, and person. Temporal wasting is present. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal, and there is no jugular venous distension. The abdomen is distended, with shifting dullness to percussion, but nontender. There is bilateral lower extremity 1+ pitting edema. Palmar erythema and multiple spider angiomas are noted. Laboratory results are as follows:

Explanation

This patient with alcohol-induced cirrhosis now has abdominal swelling, abdominal distension, and shifting dullness on percussion, indicating ascites. Although ascites often develops as a consequence of progressive cirrhosis, new-onset ascites may indicate acute obstruction of the portal or hepatic veins due to thrombus or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, abdominal ultrasound is required to evaluate the abdominal cavity (for free ﬂuid), the portal/hepatic vascular system (for clots), and the liver (for masses).

Complete blood count

Patients with cirrhosis are at extremely high risk for developing HCC (risk is 1%-8% per annum). New-onset ascites and systemic manifestations (eg, weakness, weight loss, temporal wasting) should raise suspicion for HCC, as should any sign of liver decompensation (eg, variceal bleeding). However, patients with HCC are often asymptomatic. Therefore, in any patient with cirrhosis, screening abdominal ultrasound is recommended every 6 months to evaluate for new-onset HCC. This patient who had a negative screening ultrasound 18 months ago may have developed HCC in the interim.

(Choice B) Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is associated with antimitochondrial antibodies and is characterized by fatigue, jaundice, pruritus, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Patients with PBC who develop cirrhosis have an increased risk of HCC. However, PBC is rare and occurs almost exclusively in middle-aged women.

(Choice C) The mainstay of therapy for ascites is diuresis and salt restriction; however, newonset ascites requires ultrasound prior to considering therapy.

(Choice D) Patients with congestive heart failure can develop ascites and lower extremity edema but typically have elevated jugular venous pressure. This patient's history of cirrhosis and lack of elevated jugular venous pressure make his ascites most likely due to a hepatic cause; therefore, abdominal ultrasound, not echocardiography, is recommended.

(Choice E) Lactulose is used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, which is associated with confusion and asterixis. This patient is alert and oriented; he has no evidence of encephalopathy.

Explanation

This patient with alcohol-induced cirrhosis now has abdominal swelling, abdominal distension, and shifting dullness on percussion, indicating ascites. Although ascites often develops as a consequence of progressive cirrhosis, new-onset ascites may indicate acute obstruction of the portal or hepatic veins due to thrombus or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, abdominal ultrasound is required to evaluate the abdominal cavity (for free ﬂuid), the portal/hepatic vascular system (for clots), and the liver (for masses).

Serology is negative for viral hepatitis. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Patients with cirrhosis are at extremely high risk for developing HCC (risk is 1%-8% per annum). New-onset ascites and systemic manifestations (eg, weakness, weight loss, temporal wasting) should raise suspicion for HCC, as should any sign of liver decompensation (eg, variceal bleeding). However, patients with HCC are often asymptomatic. Therefore, in any patient with cirrhosis, screening abdominal ultrasound is recommended every 6 months to evaluate for new-onset HCC. This patient who had a negative screening ultrasound 18 months ago may have developed HCC in the interim.

• A. Abdominal ultrasound (68%).

B. Antimitochondrial antibodies (4%)

C. Diuretic therapy and follow-up in 2 weeks (19%)

D. Echocardiography (3%)

E. Lactulose with follow-up in 2 weeks (4%)

(Choice B) Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is associated with antimitochondrial antibodies and is characterized by fatigue, jaundice, pruritus, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Patients with PBC who develop cirrhosis have an increased risk of HCC. However, PBC is rare and occurs almost exclusively in middle-aged women.

(Choice C) The mainstay of therapy for ascites is diuresis and salt restriction; however, newonset ascites requires ultrasound prior to considering therapy.

(Choice D) Patients with congestive heart failure can develop ascites and lower extremity edema but typically have elevated jugular venous pressure. This patient's history of cirrhosis and lack of elevated jugular venous pressure make his ascites most likely due to a hepatic cause; therefore, abdominal ultrasound, not echocardiography, is recommended.

(Choice E) Lactulose is used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, which is associated with confusion and asterixis. This patient is alert and oriented; he has no evidence of encephalopathy.

A 65-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to 4 months of abdominal pain, nausea, and occasional emesis. The pain is deep, mid-epigastric, persistent, and non-radiating. There is no consistent relationship between the pain and food intake. He has no difﬁculty swallowing, hematemesis, black stools, blood in the stool, or diarrhea. The patient thinks he may have lost weight recently. He emigrated to the United States from China 20 years ago but frequently travels to China to visit family. He has no signiﬁcant medical or surgical history. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 110/78 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 16/min. BMI is 20 kg/m?. Heart and lung sounds are normal. The upper abdomen is mildly tender to palpation but nondistended. Hepatomegaly is present. Bowel sounds are normoactive. Laboratory results are as follows:

Explanation

This patient's persistent mid-epigastric abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, weight loss, and microcytic anemia (likely iron deﬁciency) raises concern for gastric cancer. Risk is greatest in those from Eastern Asia (eg, China), Eastern Europe, and the Andean portion of South America due to diets rich in salt-preserved food and nitroso compounds, which promote gastric injury and carcinogenesis. Helicobacter pylori infection, pernicious anemia, and smoking also increase risk.

Most cases present late in the disease course when tumors have grown large enough to cause progressive epigastric abdominal pain, weight loss due to early satiety, and dysphagia or nausea/vomiting due to proximal stomach obstruction. Because friable tumor vessels often ooze blood into the gastric lumen, many patients develop iron deﬁciency anemia without overt signs of gastrointestinal bleeding ("slow bleed"). Metastases to the liver can also cause hepatomegaly, elevated alkaline phosphatase/transaminases, and signs of liver failure (eg, hypoalbuminemia).

Workup generally begins with esophagogastroduodenoscopy to visualize the stomach and to biopsy suspicious lesions. Staging imaging (eg, CT abdomen) is then usually required to evaluate for metastatic disease.

(Choice F) Pancreatic cancer often presents with subacute epigastric pain that radiates to the ﬂanks/back, weight loss, and nausea. Although pancreatic head tumors can obstruct biliary drainage and lead to elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, most obstructions also cause hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice. Furthermore, microcytic (iron deﬁciency) anemia in an elderly patient is more likely due to colon or gastric cancer than to pancreatic cancer, which does not typically bleed into the gastrointestinal tract.

Educational objective:

Gastric cancer is common in those from Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America. It generally presents with progressive epigastric pain and weight loss. Friable tumor vessels can bleed into the stomach lumen, leading to iron deﬁciency anemia. Metastasis to the liver can result in hepatomegaly and elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase.

A 67-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to a 2-day history of diarrhea and left-sided abdominal pain. The patient was seen in the emergency department 10 days ago due to left lower quadrant pain and low-grade fever; CT scan showed sigmoid diverticulitis. He was given amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy for 7 days. The patient completed the course of antibiotic therapy with good resolution of symptoms. However, over the past 2 days, he has developed left-sided abdominal pain and multiple watery stools. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 98/min. Abdominal examination shows left-sided tenderness without rebound, rigidity, or guarding. Which of the following is the most appropriate empiric therapy while studies are pending in this patient?

• • A. Fidaxomicin (36%)

While conﬁrmatory stool testing is pending, empiric antibiotic therapy with either oral ﬁdaxomicin or vancomycin is appropriate for most patients.This includes patients, such as this one, with nonsevere or severe disease; the distinction is typically based on the degree of leukocytosis (severe: > 15,000/mm3) or the serum creatinine elevation (severe: > 1.5 mg/dL).

For patients who develop fulminant CDI with hypotension/shock or ileus/megacolon, oral therapy is often supplemented with intravenous metronidazole. This bolsters the delivery of antimicrobial therapy to the inﬂamed colon, especially if impaired transit of oral antibiotic therapy is present due to ileus.

• C. D. Loperamide (5%) Metronidazole (50%)

• B. Levoﬂoxacin (5%)

• E. Neomycin (1%).

(Choice B) Levoﬂoxacin, usually with metronidazole, may be used for the outpatient treatment of diverticulitis. Although diverticulitis can cause left-sided abdominal pain and a change in bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea), profuse watery diarrhea is uncommon, and other symptoms (eg, nausea/vomiting, low-grade fever, urinary frequency) are often present. This patient's recent diverticulitis resolved with treatment; his new-onset, watery diarrhea following antibiotic therapy is most concerning for CDI.

(Choice C) Although this patient has diarrhea, an antimotility agent (eg, loperamide) should not be given empirically; if CDI is present, it may cause bacterial toxins to be retained in the colon, increasing the risk for toxic megacolon. Once antibiotic therapy for CDI is initiated, an antimotility agent may be considered.

lime soent

(Choice D) Metronidazole was once a ﬁrst-line agent for the treatment of CDI but now is considered only if ﬁdaxomicin or vancomycin are unavailable (and only for nonsevere disease) because it is less effective for achieving a symptomatic cure of CDI.

Version

(Choice E) Neomycin, typically with rifaximin, may be used to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Although SIBO can cause watery diarrhea and abdominal pain, bloating and ﬂatulence are also typically present. In addition, SIBO is unlikely following a course of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, an alternate treatment.

Educational objective:

Oral ﬁdaxomicin or vancomycin is used to treat Clostridioides difﬁcile infection in most patients, including those with nonsevere or severe disease.

Explanation

pain, nausea, and 2 episodes of vomiting over the last 2 hours. After meals for the past several weeks, the patient has had episodic epigastric and right upper quadrant pain associated with nausea. Medical history is signiﬁcant for mitral valve prolapse, obesity, and migraine headaches relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 140/92 mm Hg, and pulse is 102/min. Physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal tenderness and guarding over the upper abdomen. Stool guaiac test is positive. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

This patient's presentation is concerning for undiagnosed peptic ulcer disease (PUD) (eg, postprandial nausea/upper abdominal pain, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug [NSAID] use, positive stool guaiac test) complicated by perforation. Full-thickness erosion of a peptic ulcer through the stomach or duodenal wall releases both air and caustic (ie, pH ~ 1-2) gastric secretions/contents into the peritoneal cavity, quickly resulting in chemical peritonitis (eg, marked abdominal tenderness with guarding) and a systemic inﬂammatory response (eg, fever, tachycardia).

A. Gallbladder ultrasonography (31%)

B. Mesenteric angiography (4%)

C. NSAID avoidance and oral proton pump inhibitors (13%)

D. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy (18%)

Perforated viscus is primarily a clinical diagnosis; however, conﬁrmation can often be made quickly via demonstration of subdiaphragmatic free air (pneumoperitoneum) on upright x-ray of the chest and abdomen. When perforation is suspected and plain radiographs are negative, CT scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast can help detect smaller amounts of free air or free ﬂuid. However, CT scan should not delay surgical consultation and intervention, especially when peritonitis is present.

• E. Upright x-ray of the chest and abdomen (32%)

(Choice B) Mesenteric angiography can be used to evaluate for mesenteric ischemia. Acute mesenteric ischemia typically causes acute-onset, severe abdominal pain with a relatively benign abdominal examination (rather than diffuse tenderness and guarding) and

Intussusception is a condition in which a portion of intestine telescopes into itself, classically causing severe, episodic abdominal pain in children age 6-36 months. Most cases are idiopathic and occur at the ileocecal junction. However, 25% of patients have a pathologic lead point (ie, Meckel diverticulum, tumor, polyp) forced into a distal bowel segment during waves of peristalsis. A pathologic lead point should be suspected in patients with intussusception and the following features:

• Recurrent episodes

• Atypical location (eg, small bowel into small bowel)

• Atypical age

• Persistent rectal bleeding despite reduction

A 1-year-old boy with Down syndrome is brought to the clinic for a follow-up visit. He was

seen in the emergency department (ED) yesterday due to abdominal pain. Workup revealed a small bowel intussusception that spontaneously resolved in the ED. The patient was discharged to home, and the pain has not returned. Review of medical records shows that at age 6 months he developed small bowel intussusception, which also resolved spontaneously.

• Atypical age

• Persistent rectal bleeding despite reduction

The most common lead point is a Meckel diverticulum, a congenital malformation located in the small intestine, typically within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve. In this case, the patient's iron deﬁciency anemia also raises concern for occult bleeding, a common ﬁnding in those with Meckel diverticulum due to ulceration of heterotopic gastric mucosa; it is often found within the

B. Colonoscopy (6%)

C. CT scan of the abdomen (24%)

D. Nuclear scintigraphy (36%)

• E. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (8%)

The next step to evaluate a suspected pathologic lead point is a Meckel scan, a nuclear scintigraphy study using 99m technetium pertechnetate, which detects gastric mucosa. Other imaging studies and procedures (eg, CT scan of the abdomen, colonoscopy) may be considered if there is a high suspicion of a pathologic lead point and Meckel scan is negative

ZULS

(Choice A) Barium enema can evaluate for Hirschsprung disease (ie, narrow rectosigmoid area with dilated proximal colon), which unlike intussusception has an increased incidence in patients with Down syndrome. Symptoms may develop after the neonatal period and include occult bleeding and abdominal pain due to chronic constipation, but this condition is not associated with recurrent intussusception. Moreover, abdominal distension would be expected in patients with Hirschsprung disease.

(Choice E) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (or x-ray) can detect duodenal atresia, a condition commonly associated with Down syndrome, and would show a dilated stomach/duodenum with absent distal bowel gas. In contrast to this patient, duodenal atresia presents shortly after birth with emesis and abdominal distension (distended stomach).

Educational objective:

Although most cases of intussusception are idiopathic, a pathologic lead point should be considered in those with recurrent intussusception, particularly in an atypical location (eg, small bowel). The most common pathologic lead point is a Meckel diverticulum, which is diagnosed by nuclear scintigraphy.

A newborn boy is brought to the emergency department for coughing and difﬁculty feeding. The patient was born at home 3 hours ago via spontaneous vaginal delivery. When the mother, a 24-year-old primigravida, attempted to breastfeed him, the patient coughed and vomited. The mother had no prenatal care. She has a history of recreational drug use but says she did not use any substances during the pregnancy. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 50/min. Oxygen saturation is 95%. Ballard score estimates the boy was born at 37 weeks gestation. Weight and length are at the 25th and 50th percentiles for age, respectively. After attempting another feed with 10 mL of formula, the patient has a coughing ﬁt; there is formula mixed with saliva in his mouth. Coarse breath sounds are noted bilaterally on pulmonary examination with intercostal retractions. Cardiac examination reveals a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border. There is no hepatomegaly. Neurologic examination shows normal tone. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?

In utero, the affected fetus is unable to swallow amniotic ﬂuid, often causing polyhydramnios on prenatal ultrasound. However, the anomaly is frequently undetected until shortly after delivery when the patient develops copious oral secretions and choking, coughing, and/or vomiting with feeding attempts. Aspiration of pooled milk and secretions from the esophageal pouch and oropharynx leads to coarse lung sounds and respiratory distress (eg, retractions), as seen

here.

Version

The ﬁrst step in management is to attempt nasogastric tube placement. Inability to pass the tube into the stomach due to resistance at the esophageal pouch is consistent with the diagnosis; chest x-ray conﬁrms the tip of the catheter in the proximal esophagus. Esophagography, if performed, may reveal pooling of water-soluble contrast medium in the esophageal pouch.

Esophagography, if performed, may reveal pooling of water-soluble contrast medium in the esophageal pouch.

(Choice A) Congenital heart disease can present with difﬁculty feeding and a harsh murmur. However, cyanosis and sweating with feeds are typical, and excessive oral secretions are not expected. This newborn's murmur is likely due to a physiologic patent ductus arteriosus (classically a continuous murmur but can manifest as a systolic mumur).

(Choice B) Thickening of the epiglottis with a thumbprint sign on lateral neck x-ray is diagnostic of epiglottitis. Although this condition can cause pooling of saliva and respiratory distress, it is usually associated with fever and stridor in school-aged children, not newborns.

(Choice C) Morphine can be used to treat neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which often causes poor feeding, vomiting, and irritability in infants born to mothers with opioid use disorder. However, NAS does not cause coughing during feeds, excessive oral secretions, or coarse breath sounds. In addition, NAS (which reﬂects withdrawal symptoms) typically develops ≥24 hours of life, not immediately after birth.

(Choice E) Although it causes projectile vomiting, pyloric stenosis (eg, thickened pylorus on ultrasound) usually presents at age 3-6 weeks (after hypertrophy of the pylorus has developed), not in the newborn period.

A 48-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to sudden-onset right flank pain for 6 hours.She has never had pain like this before. Medical history includes psoriasis

on both knees, for which she uses topical vitamin D and beclomethasone. Vital signs are normal. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds are present. Abdominal imaging reveals a 3-mm stone in the right ureter and a few stones in the gallbladder. The liver and common bile duct are normal, the gallbladder is not distended, and there is no pericholecystic ﬂuid or tenderness to ultrasound probe pressure. The patient is given analgesics and intravenous ﬂuids; after a few hours, she passes the ureteral stone in the urine with complete pain relief. Which of the following is the best next step in management

of her gallstones?

This patient presented with acute right-sided ﬂank pain due to a small ureteral stone, which has now passed and led to complete resolution of her pain. During work-up of her symptoms, however, there was an incidental ﬁnding of asymptomatic gallstones. Because the majority (~80%) of patients with asymptomatic gallstones never develop symptoms, most are managed expectantly (ie, no treatment is required) and prophylactic cholecystectomy is not advised.

Patients with asymptomatic gallstones should be educated about potential complications and advised to seek treatment if symptoms develop. Should biliary colic occur, early recognition can prompt timely cholecystectomy and prevent progression to more severe disease (eg, cholecystitis). Exceptions to expectant management include patients who are at increased risk for developing gallbladder carcinoma (eg, gallbladder adenoma) and those with hemolytic diseases (eg, sickle cell disease); patients with these conditions may beneﬁt from prophylactic cholecystectomy even if their gallstones are asymptomatic.

(Choice A) HIDA scan is performed when acute cholecystitis is suspected but ultrasound is

inconclusive. This patient has no abdominal pain, and ultrasound is negative for gallbladder

distension, pericholecystic ﬂuid, and tenderness to probe pressure. Cholecystitis is very unlikely, and HIDA scan is not indicated.

(Choice B) Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is indicated in patients with biliary colic (eg, intermittent right upper quadrant [RUQ] pain) or acute cholecystitis (eg, persistent RUQ pain, fever). This patient's gallstones are asymptomatic, and cholecystectomy is not indicated.

(Choice E) Oral ursodeoxycholic acid supplementation reduces symptoms from gallstones but does not lead to complete dissolution. It is used to treat symptomatic gallstones in individuals who are poor surgical candidates but would be of no beneﬁt for asymptomatic stones.

Educational objective:

Asymptomatic gallstones typically do not require treatment because the majority do not progress to symptomatic or complicated disease. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients who develop symptomatic gallstone disease.

• Emergency sigmoid colectomy if perforation/peritonitis present This elderly patient with dementia and chronic constipation has slowly progressive (eg, over 3 days) abdominal distension/discomfort accompanied by likely obstipation (inability to pass stool or gas); this presentation is classic for sigmoid volvulus.

Sigmoid volvulus occurs when the sigmoid colon twists on its mesentery, forming a closedloop obstruction. With continued gas formation by intraluminal bacteria, the lumen of the obstructed bowel loop gradually expands. This is often visualized on abdominal x-ray as a dilated, inverted, U-shaped loop of the colon with a "coffee bean" appearance.

Management depends on whether perforation or peritonitis is present:

• Patients with perforation or peritonitis require emergency laparotomy and sigmoid colectomy (resection of the twisted/necrotic bowel).

• Patients without perforation or peritonitis, like this patient, should undergo ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy, which can be used to examine colonic viability and endoscopically reduce the twisted segment.

colectomy (resection of the twisted/necrotic bowel).

A 78-year-old woman is brought from the nursing home to the emergency department due to

worsening abdominal distension. Over the past 3 days, the patient has had decreased appetite and progressive abdominal distension that is now accompanied by diffuse abdominal discomfort. Her last bowel movement was 4 days ago. Medical history is signiﬁcant for dementia, hypertension, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and chronic constipation. Surgical history includes open appendectomy and open cholecystectomy. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min.

Abdominal x-ray is shown in the exhibit. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

• Patients without perforation or peritonitis, like this patient, should undergo ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy, which can be used to examine colonic viability and endoscopically reduce the twisted segment.

Successful most of the time (~75%-95%), ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy allows elective surgery (eg, to prevent recurrences) to be performed after full bowel preparation.

(Choice A) Emergency total abdominal colectomy may be lifesaving for those with toxic megacolon, but such patients are typically systemically ill (eg, fever, hypotension) and have x-ray ﬁndings of diffuse dilation of the colon within its normal anatomic arrangement (vs in a loop). In sigmoid volvulus, only the involved colon is removed.

• A. Emergency total abdominal colectomy (11%).

B. Manual disimpaction and laxative therapy (18%)

C. Nasogastric decompression and bowel rest only (26%)

(Choice B) Manual disimpaction and laxative therapy may be used for severe constipation with fecal impaction, but constipation without volvulus typically appears on x-ray as large amounts of stool in the colon. Peristalsis-inducing agents (eg, laxatives) are contraindicated for closed-loop obstructions (eg, volvulus) because they increase the risk of perforation.

(Choice C) Nasogastric decompression and bowel rest may be used to manage small-bowel obstruction (SBO). Although SBO can cause anorexia and abdominal distension, x-ray typically reveals multiple, dilated small-bowel loops with air-ﬂuid levels and decompressed large bowel distal to the obstruction.

(Choice E) Upper gastrointestinal series with small-bowel follow-through may be used to detect obstruction (eg, tumor, stricture) within the upper gastrointestinal tract (eg, stomach, small bowel). This patient's x-ray, which reveals a single, dilated colonic loop and proximal colonic dilation, is more consistent with lower gastrointestinal tract obstruction.

Educational objective:

Sigmoid volvulus often presents as slowly progressive abdominal discomfort/distension in an elderly patient and a "coffee bean" -shaped dilated loop of colon on abdominal x-ray. Patients without perforation or peritonitis can undergo ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy to reduce the twisted segment and avoid emergency surgery.

This patient with fever, right upper quadrant pain, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes has a rounded, hypoattenuating lesion in the liver, which is concerning for pyogenic liver abscess. Pyogenic liver abscess can occur due to direct extension from biliary tract infections, penetrating trauma, or hematogenous spread from the systemic (eg, infectious endocarditis) or portal circulation (eg, intraabdominal infection). This patient likely developed the abscess as a result of his recent diverticulitis, which allowed for the spread of bacteria from the inﬂamed intestines through the portal circulation.

Manifestations typically include fever, right upper quadrant pain (which may be severe), leukocytosis, and elevated liver function studies. The diagnosis is conﬁrmed with abdominal imaging; CT scan classically demonstrates a well-deﬁned, hypoattenuating, rounded lesion, often surrounded by a peripherally enhancing abscess membrane.

Management includes blood cultures, antibiotics, and percutaneous aspiration and drainage, which is both diagnostic (eg, culture, Gram stain) and therapeutic; catheter placement is often required to drain large lesions. Surgical drainage can be considered for abscesses not amenable to percutaneous intervention.

(Choice B) Malaria can present with fevers, anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia; however, it would not be expected to cause right upper quadrant pain or a hypoattenuating liver lesion on CT scan. It would also be unexpected in a patient who has not traveled recently.

(Choice C) Echinococcus granulosus causes cystic liver lesions in individuals exposed to infected sheep or canines; patients are typically asymptomatic unless the cysts are large or rupture. Cysts are typically visible on a CT scan as thin-walled, septated lesions, occasionally

D. Serology for Entamoeba histolytica (17%)

E. Stool test for Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile toxin (4%)

F. Stool test for ova and parasites (6%)

(Choices D and F) Entamoeba histolytica is a major cause of hepatic abscess; however, most patients with amebic liver abscess have a history of exposure in endemic areas (eg, India, Mexico). This diagnosis should be considered in patients without other, more common causes of abscess (unlike this patient with recent diverticulitis). Testing options include serology or stool analysis (eg, ova and parasite).

(Choice E) This patient is at increased risk for Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile infection due to his recent hospitalization and antibiotic treatment for diverticulitis. However, C difﬁcile infection is characterized by persistent, watery diarrhea and would not be expected to cause abscess formation.

Pyogenic liver abscess typically presents with fevers, right upper quadrant pain, leukocytosis, and altered liver function tests. It can result from direct spread from the biliary tract or from hematogenous seeding of distal infection, particularly those involving the portal system (eg, diverticulitis). Diagnosis requires abdominal imaging, and management includes blood cultures, antibiotics, aspiration, and drainage.

A 40-year-old man is evaluated in the hospital after being admitted for acute alcohol-induced

pancreatitis 24 hours ago. He has been receiving aggressive intravenous hydration and pain control.Over the past 2 hours, the patient has become increasingly restless and now reports difﬁculty breathing and abdominal distension. Blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg, pulse is 122/min, and respirations are 28/min. Heart and lung sounds are normal.

His urine output has markedly decreased over the past 2 hours. Which of the following pathophysiologic changes are most likely present in this patient at this time compared to a few hours earlier?

V • A. Decreased cardiac preload (55%)

ACS occurs when a rise in intraabdominal pressure (IAP) reduces abdominal organ perfusion to the point of causing organ dysfunction. Because elevated IAP is transmitted to the thoracic cavity through the diaphragm, ACS also has signiﬁcant cardiovascular consequences:

• Increased intraabdominal and intrathoracic pressure cause extrinsic venous compression, resulting in elevated central venous pressure (CVP) (Choice B).

• The compression restricts vena cava blood ﬂow and decreases venous return to the heart (ie, cardiac preload). Although reduced cardiac preload is typically reﬂected in a low CVP, the two are uncoupled in ACS, where CVP is increased (despite reduced preload) due to external compression rather than increased intravenous volume.

• Diaphragmatic elevation compresses the heart and decreases ventricular ﬁlling.

• Decreased cardiac preload and ventricular ﬁlling lead to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and compensatory tachycardia (Choice E).

• B. Decreased central venous pressure (16%)

C. Decreased lower extremity venous pressure (3%)

D. Increased abdominal wall compliance (7%)

E. Increased cardiac output (17%)

(Choice C) Increased IAP from ACS causes increased compression of the intraabdominal venous drainage, including the inferior vena cava and iliac veins; back pressure to the lower extremities results in increased (vs decreased) venous hydrostatic pressure and, often, peripheral edema.

(Choice D) Abdominal wall compliance cannot increase in the acute setting; therefore, a relatively small volume of rapidly accumulating intraabdominal ﬂuid can markedly increase IAP and cause ACS. In contrast, progressive abdominal wall stretching over time (eg, weeks) may greatly increase abdominal wall compliance, allowing large ﬂuid volumes (eg, >15 liters) to be accommodated without causing ACS.

Educational objective:

The increased intraabdominal and intrathoracic pressure seen in abdominal compartment syndrome can cause signiﬁcant cardiovascular consequences, including venous compression with increased central venous pressure, decreased venous return to the heart (decreased cardiac preload), and decreased cardiac output.

Correct answer

This patient's ulcerative colitis, subacute right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, biliary obstruction (eg, jaundice, elevated alkaline phosphatase, dilated intrahepatic ducts), and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 levels raise strong suspicion for cholangiocarcinoma, a highly lethal malignancy of the bile duct epithelium. Risk is greatest in those with ﬁbropolycystic liver disease or primary sclerosing cholangitis, an inﬂammatory disorder of the biliary tree that is almost always (~90%) associated with underlying ulcerative

colitis.

This patient with right upper quadrant pain, fever, jaundice, hypotension, and altered mental status (ie, Reynolds pentad) has the typical features of acute cholangitis. Acute cholangitis is an infection of the extrahepatic biliary system that usually occurs due to biliary obstruction (eg, bile stone, malignancy, stricture), which predisposes patients to bacterial invasion of the normally sterile biliary tree. In a young adult male with a history of hematochezia, the most likely etiology of recurrent acute cholangitis (eg, similar symptoms in the past) is a biliary

stricture due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

PSC is a chronic disease characterized by ﬁbrosis and stricturing of the medium and large intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. This promotes cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase,

hyperbilirubinemia) and obstruction. PSC usually affects men and is associated with

This patient has typical clinical features of early dumping syndrome (DS), including gastrointestinal (eg, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps) and vasomotor (eg, palpitations, diaphoresis) symptoms. DS is a common postgastrectomy complication, occurring in up to 50% of patients. It is caused by loss of the normal action of the pyloric sphincter due to injury or surgical bypass and leads to rapid emptying of hypertonic gastric contents into the duodenum and small intestine. This causes ﬂuid shifts from the intravascular space to the small intestine, leading to hypotension, stimulation of autonomic (sympathetic) reﬂexes, and release of intestinal vasoactive polypeptides.

version

The diagnosis of DS is based primarily on clinical features, although an upper gastrointestinal x-ray series or gastric emptying studies may be helpful if the diagnosis is unclear (Choice E). The following dietary modiﬁcations are recommended for most patients:

• Consume small, frequent meals, and eat slowly

• Avoid simple sugars

Many patients (20%) are carriers of Clostridioides difﬁcile, and false-positive results can occur with highly sensitive PCR tests, which do not differentiate toxin-producing from non-toxin-producing organisms; testing should be used only in the appropriate clinical context (eg, profuse watery diarrhea with an elevated white blood cell count).

ﬁsh bone is considered a foreign body with a high risk of esophageal perforation, therefore warranting endoscopic removal.

Although patients may be asymptomatic after ingestion, an esophageal foreign body can cause throat pain if lodged in the proximal esophagus or lower chest pain if lodged in the distal esophagus, as seen in this patient. Sharp objects (eg, needles, pins, ﬁsh bones) can lead to perforation and symptoms such as severe or acutely worsening chest/abdominal pain, vomiting with or without blood, and hemodynamic instability. Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage can lead to shock and can be fatal.

• A. Induce emesis (0%)

• B. No additional management indicated (12%)

• C. Obtain a barium esophagogram (2%)

Imaging (x-ray followed by CT scan if the object is not identiﬁed) is used to determine foreign body location and assess for free air (indicative of perforation). Although human bones are readily seen on plain radiographs, most ﬁsh bones tend to be radiolucent and can be visualized only on CT scan.

Immediate endoscopic removal should be performed in the following circumstances:

The patient previously came to the ED 3 days ago after he fell while mountain biking. He did not lose consciousness and recalls hitting the handlebars prior to ﬂipping and landing on his back. His trauma workup-which included CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis-was negative, and he was discharged. Since then, the patient has had persistent upper abdominal discomfort and nausea, along with an episode of nonbilious emesis. Temperature is 38.1 C (100.6 F), blood pressure is 104/62 mm Hg, and pulse is 108/min. The lungs are clear to auscultation, and heart sounds are normal. Ecchymosis is present across the upper abdomen, which is tender to palpation with voluntary guarding.Bowel sounds are decreased. Bedside ultrasonography reveals a large amount of free ﬂuid in the upper abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?

Explanation

This patient with a negative abdominal CT scan following blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) (eg, handlebar impact) now has persistent upper abdominal discomfort and nausea accompanied by a low-grade fever and a large upper abdominal ﬂuid collection. This presentation is most concerning for pancreatic duct injury, with resulting leakage of inﬂammatory pancreatic juice leading to accumulation of peripancreatic ﬂuid.

• C. Hepatic laceration (24%)

• D. Splenic rupture (29%)

V • E. Pancreatic duct injury (38%)

Omitted

38%

Correct answer

Pancreatic injuries may result from BAT that rapidly compresses the ﬁxed, retroperitoneal pancreas against the vertebral column. Pancreatic injury is often difﬁcult to diagnose immediately following trauma because physical examination is nonspeciﬁc, initial serum amylase and lipase levels are unreliable markers, and abdominal CT scan has variable (~50%-80%) sensitivity. Therefore, the development of the following symptoms and signs in patients with recent BAT should raise suspicion for undiagnosed pancreatic injury:

• Persistent abdominal discomfort/tenderness

• Persistent nausea/emesis

• Increasing amylase over serial measurements

• Peripancreatic ﬂuid collection (due to pancreatic duct injury) Ductal injury may require cholangiopancreatography for diagnosis. Some (eg, low-grade) pancreatic injuries can be managed nonoperatively, but most ductal injuries require surgical intervention.

Answered correctly

(Choice A) Abdominal aortic injuries due to BAT are rare (<1%). Many patients with traumatic aortic injury die from exsanguination before reaching the hospital. Those who survive (because bleeding has been initially contained within the retroperitoneum) would be extremely unlikely to have a large amount of free ﬂuid on FAST without accompanying signiﬁcant hemodynamic instability (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg).

(Choice B) Diaphragmatic rupture, which can occur after BAT due to a sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure, may result in herniation of abdominal organs into the thoracic cavity. This may trap the stomach or small bowel and cause obstructive symptoms (eg, nausea, emesis). However, it does not typically cause signiﬁcant intraabdominal free ﬂuid and is unlikely to cause a low-grade fever.

Cardiac examination is unremarkable. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Chest x-ray on anteroposterior view shows a radiopaque, circular object with a halo sign. The lateral view is shown below:

can also occur because of local inﬂammation and ischemia. Prolonged impaction can result in esophageal ulceration and perforation, hemorrhagic shock, and death.

Patients are often initially asymptomatic but may experience nausea/vomiting, anorexia, and chest pain. Fever, hematemesis, and shock are signs of life-threatening perforation. Radiographic features that distinguish the bilaminar structure of a button battery from a ﬂat

coin include:

• a halo or double-ring around the circular object on anteroposterior view (described but not visualized in this case).

• a step-off or beveled edge on lateral view (occasionally but not always seen).

Emergency endoscopic removal is the treatment for an esophageal button battery. Administering honey soon after ingestion in an asymptomatic patient may provide a partial protective barrier but should not delay deﬁnitive management. Treatment delay increases the risk of late complications (eg, esophageal stricture or stenosis).

E. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (70%)

Physical examination shows chest and abdominal ecchymoses and tenderness in Ine cistrioution or Ine seat delt. Breath sounds are equal bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is mildly tender. Chest x-ray reveals a left sixth rib fracture without pneumothorax. Focused assessment with sonography is negative for free abdominal ﬂuid. CT scan of the abdomen shows thickened proximal small bowel and a small mesenteric hematoma. The patient is hospitalized for monitoring and supportive care. Over the next 24 hours, he develops worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness with guarding. Repeat CT scan of the abdomen is shown in the image below:

in a delayed fashion (eg, several hours to days following trauma), as in this patient. Delayed perforation can be due to the following:

• Bowel contusion (eg, thickened [edematous] proximal small bowel on initial CT scan) progressing to full-thickness injury

• Injured mesenteric vasculature (eg, mesenteric hematoma on initial CT scan) progressing to ischemia and necrosis

Many patients with bowel contusion or mesenteric hematoma do not need further intervention. However, an extended period of observation should be considered due to the risk of progression to perforation, as occurred in this patient.

(Choice A) The role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) has been largely reduced to evaluating for intraabdominal hemorrhage in hemodynamically unstable patients with questionable bedside ultrasound results.

Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

• A. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (2%)

(Choice C) Mesenteric angiography can evaluate the blood supply to the small and large intestines in cases of suspected injury, occlusion, or bleeding. Although this patient may have had injury to his mesenteric vessels (eg, mesenteric hematoma) that led to necrosis and perforation, angiography should not delay surgical intervention once perforation is conﬁrmed.

B. Increased analgesia and close observation (0%)

C. Mesenteric angiography (3%)

D. Surgical exploration (93%)

E. Upper gastrointestinal series (0%)

(Choice E) An upper Gl series uses contrast to outline the lumen of the upper GI tract and, depending on the exact location of this patient's perforation, may demonstrate contrast leaking through the perforation. However, this study is time-consuming (eg, time to drink contrast, time for contrast to pass through the Gl system) and unnecessary because the diagnosis of perforation has already been established by CT scan.

Blunt abdominal trauma can cause gastrointestinal perforation in an acute or a delayed (eg, progression of bowel contusion, mesenteric ischemia) fashion. Conﬁrmation of perforation (eg, intraperitoneal free air on imaging) should prompt emergent surgical exploration.

hepatobiliary system). However, in patients with emphysematous cholecystitis, unlike other forms of acute cholecystitis, ultrasound is less sensitive due to the modality's poor visualization of air-ﬁlled structures; extensive gas in the gallbladder wall may be falsely interpreted as failure to identify the gallbladder due to overlying bowel loops. Laboratory ﬁndings include mild to moderate unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (eg, from Clostridium-induced hemolysis) and a small elevation in aminotransferases. Treatment requires emergency cholecystectomy and broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic therapy (eg, piperacillin-tazobactam).

There is no gas in the biliary tree. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

(Choice A) Although acute cholangitis (usually from common bile duct obstruction) is also characterized by high fever and RUQ pain, jaundice is much more common (Charcot triad), signiﬁcant elevations in alkaline phosphatase and conjugated bilirubin would be more likely, and imaging would show bile duct dilation without gas in the biliary tree or gallbladder wall. (Choices B and D) Biliary-enteric ﬁstulas are extremely rare and typically occur due to pressure ulceration from chronic gallstone disease, not acute cholecystitis. They cause pneumobilia but would not be expected to cause gas within the gallbladder wall itself (intramural gas) and are not typically associated with fevers or sepsis. Large bowel ﬁstulas are characterized by bile acid diarrhea whereas ﬁstulas with the small bowel are often asymptomatic but may cause gallstone ileus, which presents with symptoms of intermittent bowel obstruction (eg, nausea, diffuse abdominal pain) over several days as the gallstone moves through the intestines.

• E. Peptic ulcer perforation (0%).

Emphysematous cholecystitis is a life-threatening form of acute cholecystitis that occurs more commonly in patients with immunosuppression (eg, diabetes) or vascular disease.It arises due to infection of the gallbladder wall with gas-forming bacteria and requires emergency cholecystectomy.

A 66-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to worsening abdominal pain. Over the past week, he has had vague left lower abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, and constipation. This morning, the patient had sudden, severe lower abdominal pain accompanied by light-headedness and an episode of vomiting. The pain initially improved but then gradually intensiﬁed to involve the entire abdomen. Medical history is signiﬁcant for coronary artery disease and a remote appendectomy. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 110/54 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 20/min. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative but appears uncomfortable. Heart and lung sounds are normal. Bowel sounds are diminished. The abdomen is diffusely tender with guarding and rebound tenderness. Abdominal imaging is most likely to reveal which of the following ﬁndings in this patient?

Explanation

This older patient with weeklong symptoms of likely diverticulitis (eg, vague left lower abdominal discomfort, anorexia, constipation) experienced sudden, severe abdominal pain that temporarily improved and then spread to his entire abdomen. This presentation, now accompanied by fever and peritonitis (eg, guarding, rebound tenderness), is most consistent with diverticular perforation.Because free (ie, noncontained) perforation causes colonic contents to spill into the peritoneal cavity, free air is typically visible on abdominal imaging (eg, upright x-ray, CT scan).

Patients with free perforation of the gastrointestinal tract in the setting of ongoing inﬂammation (eg, diverticulitis) often have a classic pain sequence:

• A. Colonic dilation with loss of haustral markings (10%)

B. Dilated small bowel with a transition point (11%)

C. Embolic occlusion of a mesenteric artery (20%)

• D. Free air in the peritoneal cavity (55%).

• E. Hematoma surrounding the abdominal aorta (1%)

• Moment of perforation: sudden, severe pain (‡ vomiting, light-headedness or syncope)

• After perforation to 2 hours: temporary relief or decreased pain as the inﬂamed organ decompresses

Unlike diverticular microperforation (ie, contained perforation), which usually responds to medical management (eg, antibiotics, bowel rest), free (macro) perforation (recognized by free air or contrast leak on CT scan) is a surgical emergency requiring abdominal washout and resection of the ruptured bowel segment.

(Choice A) Colonic dilation with loss of haustral markings may be seen in toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon can cause fever, abdominal pain, and peritonitis. However, bloody diarrhea is typically present, as is a history of inﬂammatory bowel disease or recent antibiotic therapy (leading to Clostridioides difﬁcile infection).

(Choice B) Dilated small bowel with a transition point is seen in small bowel obstruction. This condition more commonly causes crampy (vs sudden and severe) pain of the midabdomen and increased, high-pitched (vs diminished) bowel sounds without peritonitis, unless perforation has occurred, in which case free air would be revealed on imaging.

A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to abdominal pain that started approximately 24 hours ago and is described as diffuse, severe, and stabbing. The pain is associated with frequent bilious emesis, and he is unable to tolerate any oral intake. The patient's last bowel movement was over 24 hours ago, and he is passing minimal ﬂatus. He has had nausea, anorexia, and intermittent abdominal pain for the last 6 months. The patient has never required surgery. His family emigrated from Indonesia 4 weeks ago. Temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 112/78 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 12/min. Mucous membranes are pale and dry. Heart and lung sounds are unremarkable aside from tachycardia. The abdomen is diffusely tender and distended without rebound or involuntary guarding. Bowel sounds are high-pitched and loud. Laboratory results are as follows:

Explanation

This patient with abdominal pain and distension, high-pitched bowel sounds, obstipation, and imaging demonstrating small bowel dilation with air-ﬂuid levels has a small bowel obstruction (SBO). In a patient with peripheral eosinophilia and recent emigration from an endemic region (eg, Asia, Africa, South America), this presentation is concerning for ascariasis. Ascaris lumbricoides is a parasitic roundworm spread via fecal-oral transmission. Ingested eggs hatch in the colon, and larvae penetrate the colonic wall to spread hematogenously to the lungs, where they are coughed up, swallowed, and mature into egg-laying adult worms in the small intestine.

A 52-year-old woman undergoes laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to recurrent episodes

Explanation

of biliary colic. During the surgery, a blunt trocar is inserted near the umbilicus under direct vision (ie, open technique), and pneumoperitoneum is achieved via insufﬂation of the abdomen with carbon dioxide. Three additional trocars are inserted, and the cholecystectomy is completed uneventfully. After a period of observation in the postanesthesia care unit, the patient is discharged home. Three days later, the patient returns to the emergency department due to persistent abdominal pain and nausea. She takes acetaminophen and hydrocodone every 6 hours. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 120/68 mm Hg, and pulse is 104/min. Physical examination shows intact port incisions with no erythema or discharge. There is mild generalized tenderness of the abdomen with some guarding. Bowel sounds are diminished. The remainder of the examination is normal. Laboratory testing shows leukocytes at 16,000/mm3; serum electrolytes and bilirubin are normal. Abdominal x-ray reveals generalized distension of the small and large bowel, stool in the distal colon, and intraperitoneal free air. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

• A. Administer a rectal enema and obtain a repeat abdominal x-ray (6%)

This patient who underwent laparoscopic surgery now has ﬁndings concerning for early intraabdominal infection, including persistent abdominal pain, fever, abdominal guarding, ileus (eg, diminished bowel sounds, small- and large-bowel distension), and leukocytosis. The best next step is abdominal CT scan with oral contrast to evaluate for possible unrecognized bowel injury (eg, bowel puncture when intraabdominal access is obtained, thermal injury when electrosurgical instruments are used).

Bowel injuries that are recognized intraoperatively are immediately repaired. Some injuries, however, go unrecognized and may not be diagnosed until patients seek care later with symptoms arising from the spillage of gastrointestinal contents, which may cause varying degrees of inﬂammation.

• Postoperative patients with frank peritonitis do not require abdominal imaging prior to surgical reexploration (although, in practice, imaging is often obtained en route to the operating room).

B. Admit for supportive care of postoperative ileus (33%)

C. Obtain a CT scan of the abdomen with oral contrast (48%)

D. Perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (6%)

E. Reassure that ﬁndings are as expected and give additional pain control (5%)

• Patients (such as this one) with concerning ﬁndings but without frank peritonitis (eg, some guarding but no rigidity or rebound tenderness) should undergo abdominal CT scan to evaluate for bowel injury. The use of oral contrast, given by nasogastric tube if necessary, assists with detecting the site of leakage (eg, extraluminal contrast extravasation).

Intraperitoneal free air, as seen on this patient's x-ray, is normally present for days following procedural pneumoperitoneum and is therefore not speciﬁc for bowel perforation.

A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 8 hours of constant epigastric pain, which has become more severe and diffuse over the past 2 hours. He also has nausea and has had one episode of vomiting containing bile but no blood. The patient has been having episodic upper abdominal discomfort that occasionally awakens him from sleep but is relieved by antacids.Other medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, persistent atrial ﬁbrillation, and chronic kidney disease. Medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, metoprolol, warfarin, insulin lispro, and glargine. Temperature is 38.2 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min and irregular. BMI is 36 kg/m?. The patient is in moderate distress due to pain. The abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation with rigidity, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are absent. Laboratory ﬁndings are as follows:

Nasogastric suction, intravenous crystalloid, and antibiotics are started, and an urgent surgery is planned. Which of the following additional interventions is most appropriate at

present?

Explanation

This patient has an acute abdomen (guarding, rebound tenderness) with subdiaphragmatic (intraperitoneal) free air. This presentation suggests perforation of a hollow abdominal viscus, likely due to a duodenal or gastric ulcer (given the patient's history of intermittent upper abdominal pain relieved with antacids), which requires nasogastric tube decompression, intravenous ﬂuids, antibiotics, and urgent surgical evaluation. In addition, this patient takes warfarin for atrial ﬁbrillation, and his warfarin-induced anticoagulation should be reversed. Indeed, therapeutic anticoagulation with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 (eg, 2.1 in this patient) is appropriate for the chronic management of atrial ﬁbrillation; however, if not corrected preoperatively, therapeutic anticoagulation can predispose patients to intra- and postoperative bleeding complications.

Patients taking warfarin who require anticoagulation reversal (eg, urgent surgery with a high risk of bleeding, signiﬁcant hemorrhage) should be managed as follows:

• Warfarin should be discontinued immediately.

• Patients (particularly those with an INR >2) should receive prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), a concentrate of vitamin K-dependent cofactors. Three-factor PCC contains factors II, IX, and X with small amounts of protein C and S, whereas 4factor PCC, the preferred agent, also contains therapeutic quantities of factor VII. PCC rapidly normalizes the INR, typically in ≤10 minutes; however, the effects are transient

(hours).

• Intravenous vitamin K should also be administered to provide substrate for synthesis of new vitamin K-dependent clotting factors by the liver (particularly given the transient effects of PCC).

If PCC is unavailable, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can be administered; however, it is less effective and typically requires transfusion of multiple units, increasing the risk of volume overload.

(Choice A) Colloids include FFP and albumin. FFP can be used if PCC is unavailable, whereas albumin is indicated in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

• Warfarin should be discontinued immediately.

• A. Intravenous colloid infusion (7%)

• B. Intravenous desmopressin (4%)

C. Packed red blood cell transfusion (10%)

D. Prothrombin complex concentrate (70%)

E. Single-donor platelet transfusion (6%)

• Patients (particularly those with an INR >2) should receive prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), a concentrate of vitamin K-dependent cofactors. Three-factor PCC contains factors II, IX, and X with small amounts of protein C and S, whereas 4factor PCC, the preferred agent, also contains therapeutic quantities of factor VII. PCC rapidly normalizes the INR, typically in ≤10 minutes; however, the effects are transient

(hours).

• Intravenous vitamin K should also be administered to provide substrate for synthesis of new vitamin K-dependent clotting factors by the liver (particularly given the transient effects of PCC).

• A. Intravenous colloid infusion (7%)

• B. Intravenous desmopressin (4%),

(Choice B) Desmopressin is given preoperatively to patients with mild hemophilia A to prevent excessive bleeding. It indirectly increases factor VIII levels by causing von Willebrand factor release from endothelial cells.

C. Packed red blood cell transfusion (10%)

D. Prothrombin complex concentrate (70%)

E. Single-donor platelet transfusion (6%)

(Choice C) The decision to transfuse patients preoperatively is based on underlying risk factors for ischemic heart disease and anticipated blood loss during surgery. In general, tissue oxygen delivery does not become deﬁcient until the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL. Although preparations for blood transfusion (eg, consent, type and screen) should be made, reversal of this patient's anticoagulation is more appropriate at this time.

A 55-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to acute onset midepigastric pain that radiates to her back.She also has nausea and vomiting. Past medical history is signiﬁcant for plantar fasciitis and hypertension, for which she takes amlodipine. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Her temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F),

blood pressure is 117/76 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 16/min. Examination shows tenderness to deep palpation in the epigastrium. The remainder of the examination is within normal limits. Laboratory test results are as follows:

Explanation

This patient's midepigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and markedly elevated amylase and lipase are consistent with acute pancreatitis. As this patient does not drink alcohol and has elevated liver function enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase) with several gallstones on ultrasound, her pancreatitis is most likely due to gallstones (second most common cause of pancreatitis). Some studies have shown that ALT >150 U/L has a 95% positive predictive value for diagnosing gallstone pancreatitis.

Once this patient's symptoms and laboratory values have improved, her attack of acute pancreatitis is considered mild and resolved. However, she is at increased risk for recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis due to gallstones. Early cholecystectomy is recommended for medically stable patients who recover from acute pancreatitis and are surgical candidates. Cholecystectomy can markedly reduce the risk of recurrent gallstone pancreatitis.

A 56-year-old man is evaluated for fever on postoperative day 3. He just had coronary artery bypass surgery for multivessel coronary artery disease, requiring 4 grafts. The patient is still intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min. BMI is 28 kg/m?. Examination demonstrates coarse breath sounds bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. The patient grimaces during palpation of the right upper quadrant. Bowel sounds are decreased. Laboratory results are as follows:

Treatment

• Prolonged fasting or TPN

• Critical illness (eg, sepsis, ICU)

• Fever, RUQ pain, leukocytosis, + 1 LFTs

• Jaundice & RUQ mass less common

• Abdominal ultrasonography (preferred)

• HIDA or CT scan if needed

• Enteric antibiotic coverage

• Cholecystostomy for initial drainage

• Cholecystectomy once clinically stable

ICU = intensive care unit; LFTs = liver function tests; RUQ = right upper quadrant; TPN = total parenteral nutrition.

This patient's presentation suggests acalculous cholecystitis, an acute inﬂammation of the gallbladder without gallstones. Acalculous cholecystitis is most often seen in critically ill hospitalized patients. Common predisposing conditions include the following:

• Recent surgery (particularly cardiopulmonary, aortic, or abdominal)

• Severe trauma, extensive burns, sepsis, or shock

• Critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation

• B. Acute cholangitis (12%)

• C. Acute pancreatitis (6%)

• Prolonged fasting or total parenteral nutrition

D. Right lower lobe pneumonia (5%)

These conditions likely cause gallbladder stasis or ischemia with local inﬂammation that leads to gallbladder distension, necrosis, and secondary bacterial infection.

• E. Right-sided pyelonephritis (1%)

• F. Subphrenic abscess (25%)

Acalculous cholecystitis can present with unexplained fever and right upper quadrant (RUQ) or diffuse abdominal pain. Sometimes, a RUQ mass (distended gallbladder) can be palpated. Leukocytosis is typical, but liver function tests may be normal or elevated, depending on

Chest x-ray reveals postoperative changes but no new inﬁltrate. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

•• A. Acalculous cholecystitis (47%)

Leukocytosis is typical, but liver function tests may be normal or elevated, depending on whether there is associated hepatic inﬂammation and/or surrounding edema applying extrinsic pressure on the biliary tract. The diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion because most affected patients are intubated, sedated, or too ill to verbalize symptoms.

Abdominal ultrasonography, which can reveal signs of acute cholecystitis without gallstones, is the imaging modality of choice initially and can be performed at the bedside in critically ill patients. Patients with unclear ultrasonographic ﬁndings may need further imaging with abdominal CT scan or cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan). Deﬁnitive management includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and percutaneous cholecystostomy. Cholecystectomy is performed once the patient's medical condition improves.

(Choice B) Acute cholangitis, an ascending biliary tract infection typically caused by bile duct obstruction, classically presents with fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice (Charcot triad), plus laboratory evidence of cholestasis (eg, elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase). This patient has normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, making cholangitis unlikely.

(Choice C) Acute pancreatitis can occur postoperatively in patients with hypotension (similar to acalculous cholecystitis). However, it is less likely due to this patient's RUQ, rather than epigastric, tenderness and normal amylase levels.

(Choice D) Right lower lobe pneumonia can present with fever, cough, and, sometimes, RUQ pain. However, pneumonia is less likely given the absence of a new inﬁltrate on this patient's chest x-ray. This patient's coarse breath sounds are bilateral and likely from excess upper airway secretions due to mechanical ventilation.

(Choice E) Right-sided pyelonephritis usually presents with fever, nausea, and right ﬂank (not RUQ) pain.

• B. Acute cholangitis (12%)

• C. Acute pancreatitis (6%)

(Choice F) Subphrenic abscess (rare) can cause fever and abdominal pain. However, it usually develops due to peritonitis (eg, perforated ulcer, appendicitis, abdominal surgery) and is unlikely in this patient who did not undergo an abdominal procedure.

D. Right lower lobe pneumonia (5%)

Educational objective:

• E. Right-sided pyelonephritis (1%)

• F. Subphrenic abscess (25%).

Acute acalculous cholecystitis is acute inﬂammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones; it is most commonly seen in hospitalized and critically ill patients.

The causes of esophageal dysphagia can be broadly divided into mechanical obstruction and dysmotility. As in this patient, dysphagia that starts with solids and progresses (eg, difﬁculty swallowing solids leading to diet modiﬁcation to soft foods) is characteristic of mechanical obstruction (eg, tumor, stricture, rings); eventually, patients can develop dysphagia to liquids. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be performed to enable direct visualization of the esophageal and gastric lumens. Endoscopy also allows for tissue sampling for histologic diagnosis and therapeutic interventions (eg, stricture dilation).

In contrast, esophageal dysphagia involving both solids and liquids at onset suggests a motility disorder (eg, achalasia) and is evaluated with motility studies (eg, modiﬁed barium swallow, esophageal manometry), typically around the same time as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to rule out mechanical obstruction (Choice C).

(Choice A) A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial is appropriate for treating gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. However, this patient has a concerning symptom (dysphagia) that could indicate a mechanical cause such as stricture or esophageal adenocarcinoma; reﬂux is a risk factor for both. Therefore, endoscopy should be performed.

(Choice B) CT scan of the chest does not allow visualization of the esophageal and gastric lumens and therefore is less sensitive than upper endoscopy in diagnosing early cancer. Typically, a CT scan is performed after a cancer diagnosis (by endoscopic biopsy) to evaluate Tor metastauc aisease.

than dysphagia. Progressive esophageal dysphagia requires endoscopic evaluation to assess

for mechanical obstruction and to rule out malignancy.

Progressive esophageal dysphagia involving solid food is characterized by the sensation that food sticks within the chest. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be performed to diagnose the cause of suspected mechanical obstruction (eg, tumor, stricture, web, ring, inﬂammation).

This patient has symptoms of gastroparesis (eg, bloating, early satiety, postprandial emesis, food aversion, weight loss) after Nissen fundoplication, a surgical procedure used to treat gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. During this procedure, the fundus is folded and sewn around the lower esophageal sphincter to decrease the amount of gastric acid that reﬂuxes into the esophagus.

Branches of the vagus nerve [CN X] are in close proximity to the distal esophagus and fundus and may be inadvertently damaged during Nissen fundoplication. This can cause gastroparesis because these nerve branches are required for gastric muscular contraction and peristalsis to take place. A scintigraphic gastric emptying scan (which measures the percentage of a standard meal left in the stomach after a set number of hours) is diagnostic of gastroparesis in the absence of obstruction, which must be ruled out with esophaaoaastroduodenoscoov with or without small bowel imaaina.

A 40-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce for follow-up. The patient underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for severe gastroesophageal reﬂux disease 6 weeks ago, after which he developed nausea, early satiety, epigastric discomfort, and postprandial bloating. Symptoms are relieved after he vomits partially digested food. The patient says, "I am fearful of eating and have lost 10 lb since surgery." He has no dysphagia, odynophagia, constipation, or diarrhea.Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 15/min. Abdominal examination reveals well-healed surgical incisions and no tenderness or distension. Bowel sounds are normal. An upper GI series shows no obstruction. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

Management options for gastroparesis include dietary modiﬁcation (eg, small meals; low-fat, low-soluble-ﬁber diet) and promotility agents (eg, metoclopramide).

(Choice A) CT angiography of the abdomen can demonstrate chronic mesenteric ischemia, which commonly causes postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss; vomiting and early satiety are rare.Mesenteric ischemia is usually diagnosed in individuals age >65 with multiple cardiac comorbidities and is not an expected complication of Nissen fundoplication.

• A. CT angiography of the abdomen (3%).

• B. Esophageal dilation (5%)

• C. Esophageal manometry (16%)

(Choices B and C) Dysphagia is common within 12 weeks of Nissen fundoplication and usually self-resolves. For patients with long-standing dysphagia after surgery (eg, > 12 weeks), a barium swallow (or esophageal manometry) can identify narrowing of the distal esophagus. These individuals beneﬁt from esophageal dilation, a procedure usually performed during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Because this patient does not have dysphagia and a barium study (eg, upper Gl series) has already ruled out esophageal narrowing, neither manometry nor esophageal dilation would be beneﬁcial at this time.

(Choice D) Gas-bloat syndrome, which is characterized by bloating and an inability to belch, may develop after Nissen fundoplication. Patients can be reassured of the benign nature of this disorder, which usually resolves over time with simethicone and avoidance of carbonated beverages. This patient's symptoms of vomiting and weight loss, which cannot be explained by gas-bloat syndrome, suggest gastroparesis and require appropriate diagnostic work-up.

Answered correctly

Educational objective:

Inadvertent damage to vagal nerve [CN X] branches can occur during Nissen fundoplication, a surgical procedure used to treat gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. This may result in gastroparesis, a disorder that causes bloating, early satiety, postprandial emesis, food aversion, and weight loss. A scintigraphic gastric emptying scan is diagnostic in the absence of obstruction (eg, negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy ‡ small bowel imaging).

A 75-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to worsening generalized abdominal pain and nausea for the past 2 days. He has multiple chronic medical conditions and resides at a nursing facility. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 128/74 mm Hg, and pulse is 94/min. Abdominal examination shows distension and diffuse tenderness without rigidity or rebound tenderness. Abdominal x-ray is shown in the image

• Slowly progressive abdominal discomfort/distension ≤ obstructive symptoms (eg, nausea, emesis, obstipation)

• Abdomen distended & tympanitic to percussion

• X-ray: dilated, inverted, U-shaped loop of colon (coffee bean sign)

• CT scan: dilated sigmoid colon, mesenteric twisting (whirl sign)

• Endoscopic detorsion (eg, ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy) & elective sigmoid

colectomy

• Emergency sigmoid colectomy if perforation/peritonitis present

This patient's presentation is consistent with sigmoid volvulus, a condition that occurs most commonly in debilitated or institutionalized elderly adults with a history of constipation.

Sigmoid volvulus occurs when a segment of sigmoid colon twists on its mesentery, forming a

closed-loop obstruction. With continued gas formation by intraluminal bacteria, the lumen of the obstructed bowel loop gradually expands. This leads to slowly progressive (eg, over 2 days) abdominal distension and discomfort frequently accompanied by loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and/or obstipation. As in this patient, abdominal x-ray often reveals a dilated, inverted, U-shaped loop of colon with the appearance of a "coffee bean."

Increased length (causing redundancy) of the sigmoid colon compared to its mesentery increases the risk that the sigmoid colon will twist around its mesentery. Because chronic constipation, which causes chronic fecal overloading, can lead to dilation and elongation of the sigmoid colon, it is considered a risk factor for sigmoid volvulus. Colonic hypomotility (eg, neurogenic bowel in neurologic disorders, diabetic enteropathy) can contribute to constipation and increase the risk of volvulus (Choice B).

Which of the following factors in this patient's history most likely increased the risk for developing this condition?

• A. Chronic constipation (45%)

(Choice C) Electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, which cause muscle dysfunction) can cause paralytic ileus. Ileus typically appears on x-ray as generalized, uniform distension of the large and small bowel. In contrast, this patient's single dilated loop of bowel indicates a closed-loop obstruction (eg, sigmoid volvulus).

B. Colonic hypermotility (10%)

C. Electrolyte abnormalities (24%)

(Choice D) The use of nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, which is common in the elderly population, can be complicated by gastroduodenal ulceration and perforation. However, gastrointestinal tract perforation classically appears on x-ray as free air under the diaphragm.

• D. Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug use (0%) E. Recent antibiotic therapy (19%)

(Choice E) Antibiotic therapy may be complicated by Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile colitis, which can lead to toxic megacolon with colonic dilation. However, x-ray typically reveals diffuse dilation of the colon within its normal anatomic arrangement, rather than in a loop, and patients typically appear toxic (eg, fever, altered sensorium) and may have severe bloody diarrhea, unlike in this patient.

He has been receiving intravenous crystalloid resuscitation titrated to an adequate urine output, and the burns have undergone initial débridement and dressing with topical antimicrobial ointment. Temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 132/86 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. The patient is mildly sedated but arousable. Burn dressings are intact with some serous drainage, and the abdomen is soft and nondistended. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient's nutrition?

Like other trauma patients, those with moderate to severe burn injuries often develop a hypermetabolic response characterized by increased energy expenditure and protein catabolism. In such patients, early nutritional support can offset hypermetabolism and improve outcomes.

Enteral nutrition (EN) (ie, intestinal route) is preferred over parenteral (ie, intravenous) nutrition in patients with burn injuries because EN is associated with multiple clinical beneﬁts, including the following:

A. Dextrose-containing fluids now (15%)

B. Enteral nutrition after 72 hours (8%)

C. Enteral nutrition now (40%)

D. Parenteral nutrition after 72 hours (8%)

E. Parenteral nutrition now (26%)

Thrombosed external hemorrhoids are usually managed conservatively when the pain is tolerable, but urgent hemorrhoidectomy is indicated for severe and/or worsening pain when the patient presents within 72 hours of pain onset. Hemorrhoidectomy enables complete excision of the hemorrhoid and provides immediate relief. Beyond 72 hours, hemorrhoidectomy is typically not needed urgently because the clot begins to organize and contract, leading to symptomatic improvement (although hemorrhoidectomy may eventually be necessary due to recurrence).

(Choices B and C) Infrared coagulation, rubber band ligation, and sclerotherapy are all used to treat symptomatic, nonthrombosed internal hemorrhoids when conservative management fails. These procedures are contraindicated with external hemorrhoids, which are somatically innervated (eg, below the dentate line), because they would cause severe pain.

2023

version

(Choices D and E) In patients with mild and nondebilitating pain, thrombosed external hemorrhoids can resolve with conservative management consisting of stool softeners, sitz baths, and topical anti-inﬂammatory and antispasmodic medications (eg, glucocorticoid suppositories, nitroglycerin cream). This patient has excruciating and worsening pain and presents within the ﬁrst 72 hours; deﬁnitive treatment with hemorrhoidectomy is appropriate. Antibiotics are indicated for perirectal abscess but not for a thrombosed hemorrhoid.

Educational objective:

Thrombosed external hemorrhoids usually appear as purple or blue anal masses below the dentate line, and they cause severe pain. Although conservative management (eg, ﬁber, topical anti-inﬂammatory and antispasmodic drugs) is sufﬁcient in most cases, patients with severe and/or worsening pain who present within 72 hours should undergo hemorrhoidectomy.

Weight-loss medication is indicated for patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m (obese) and those with a BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m? (overweight) with weight-related complications. Primary ﬁrst-line options include orlistat and liraglutide; combination drugs, including naltrexone/bupropion and phentermine/topiramate, can also be considered. The choice of drug is individualized based on comorbidities, concurrent medications, and side-effect proﬁle.

A 54-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to 2 days of abdominal pain.

Explanation

She has also had anorexia, nausea, hiccups, and shortness of breath.The patient was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy 10 days ago. She had been recovering well until the abdominal pain returned. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and prior cholecystectomy for choleliths.Temperature is 39.3 C (102.8 F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 94/min, and respirations are 24/min. BMI is 30 kg/m?. No scleral icterus or skin rash is present.Breath sounds are decreased at the right base. The abdomen is mildly distended, and palpation of the right upper quadrant elicits pain. The abdominal surgical incisions are mildly tender without surrounding erythema or discharge. Bowel sounds are decreased. Leukocyte count is 24,000/mm3, and chest x-ray reveals a right pleural effusion. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition?

This patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy 10 days ago and now has right upper quadrant pain, fever, leukocytosis, and pulmonary manifestations (shortness of breath, hiccups, right-sided effusion), suggesting a subphrenic abscess.

Infections are the most common complication of appendectomy, and risk of intra-abdominal abscess is signiﬁcantly greater with laparoscopic appendectomy than laparotomy. Manifestations typically include recurrent fever and abdominal symptoms (eg, pain, vomiting) several days after an abdominal operation. Diagnosis usually requires CT scan of the abdomen. Most patients are treated with drainage and intravenous antibiotics.

A 48-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to fever and malaise for the past 2 days. He also complains of fatigue and lethargy but not nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria. Medical history is signiﬁcant for alcoholic cirrhosis, which was treated with an orthotopic liver transplant 10 weeks ago. Current medications include tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and low-dose prednisone.Temperature is 38.1 C (100.6 F), blood pressure is 125/82, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient is awake and oriented to person, place, and time.Scleral icterus is present. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. There is a well-healed surgical scar on the abdomen but no tenderness or distension. Laboratory results are as follows:

Complete blood count Hemoglobin Leukocytes Platelets

12.9 g/dL 6,000/mm3 345,000/mm3

Explanation

This patient with a recent liver transplant who now has fevers, malaise, and liver function test (LFT) elevations exhibits histologic ﬁndings concerning for acute cellular rejection (ACR).

ACR usually occurs within the ﬁrst 3 months after transplant and results from the patient's own immune system targeting the liver allograft. Although some patients have fevers, malaise, and lethargy, many are completely asymptomatic. Therefore, in patients with a recent liver transplant, ACR is often suspected based upon the development of LFT abnormalities (eg, elevations in aminotransferases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase). Deﬁnitive diagnosis is made by liver biopsy, which classically reveals:

• mixed inﬂammatory inﬁltration of the portal tracts involving eosinophils, neutrophils,

and lymphocytes

• interlobular bile duct destruction (often referred to as nonsuppurative cholangitis)

• endotheliitis (ie, lymphocytic subendothelial invasion of the portal and hepatic veins), which is the most reliable sign of ACR.

Liver function studies

Total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase 378 U/L Aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 345 U/L Alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 473 U/L

A liver biopsy shows inﬂammatory inﬁltration of the portal tracts consisting of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Interlobular bile duct destruction and prominent endotheliitis are both present. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

• A. Administer high-dose corticosteroids (80%)

The mainstay of therapy for ACR is increased immunosuppression, which typically reverses the rejection. Most patients are treated successfully with high-dose corticosteroids. In steroid-refractory cases, thymoglobulin, sirolimus, and other immunosuppressants can be used. Very rarely, if a patient fails to respond to any immunosuppressant, a repeat transplant is required.

(Choice B) The immunosuppressant mycophenolate is most commonly associated with cytopenias and gastrointestinal (eg, pain, vomiting, diarrhea) side effects. It is generally discontinued in patients with active infection due to the risk of neutropenia.This patient's

findings do not suggest side effects of mycophenolate (eg, no cytopenia, no gastrointestinal symptoms), and his biopsy results are consistent with ACR.

• B. Discontinue mycophenolate (5%).

C. Initiate ursodeoxycholic acid therapy (5%)

(Choice C) Ursodeoxycholic acid is used in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). The classic histologic ﬁnding in PBC is a ﬂorid duct lesion, deﬁned as inﬂammation limited to the bile duct. Endotheliitis and mixed-inﬂammatory inﬁltration of the portal tract are not expected in PBC.

This patient has a villous adenoma, a high-risk precursor for colorectal cancer (CRC). Major risk factors for CRC include a personal or family history of adenomatous polyps or colon cancer, inherited CRC syndromes (eg, Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis), ulcerative colitis, prior abdominopelvic radiation therapy, and tobacco and alcohol use.

In addition, obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased risk for CRC, especially early-onset (ie, age <50) cancer, likely due to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia results in increased circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, which inhibits colorectal epithelial cell apoptosis and promotes neoplastic progression. In addition, obesity is associated with increased expression of inﬂammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), which may promote development of CRC.

(Choice A) A high intake of coffee and tea is associated with a modestly decreased risk of CRC, possibly due to antioxidant and antimutagenic compounds or effects on the gut microbiome.

(Choice B) Although human papillomavirus can cause anal and cervical squamous cell carcinoma, it does not lead to adenomatous colon polyps or CRC.

(Choice C) Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen) and aspirin inhibit cyxlooxygenase-2, an enzyme thought to be involved in colon carcinogenesis. Chronic use of these medications can lower the risk of CRC, although it is not usually recommended due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and renal failure.

(Choice E) Several compounds found in red meat and processed foods can promote colon tumorigenesis. Frequent (eg, daily) consumption of red meat has been associated with increased risk of CRC, but intermittent consumption, as in this patient, is not a signiﬁcant risk

factor.

Educational objective:

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenocarcinoma, likely due to hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia results in increased circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, which inhibits colorectal epithelial cell apoptosis and promotes neoplastic progression.

A 66-year-old woman is found to have anemia during her annual medical evaluation.The

Explanation

patient feels well and has had no shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, unexpected weight changes, abdominal pain, nausea, or black tarry or bloody stools. Medical history is signiﬁcant for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and hypertension. Screening colonoscopy 6 years ago was normal. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 133/86 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 12/min. The oropharynx is normal. Heart and lung sounds are unremarkable. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended. Rectal examination shows external hemorrhoids. Testing of the stool for occult blood is positive. Complete blood count demonstrates a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL with microcytosis. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this

patient?

• A. Colonoscopy (72%).

This older patient has an occult gastrointestinal bleed (OGIB) characterized by iron deﬁciency anemia (eg, microcytosis, hypochromia) and/or a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) without overt (visible) bleeding (eg, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia). Patients are usually asymptomatic. A positive FOBT suggests a colonic bleeding source but does not rule out proximal pathology and/or colonic lesions not actively bleeding.OGIBs may originate from the colon (eg, malignancy, polyps), upper Gl tract (eg, peptic ulcer), or, less commonly, the small bowel (eg, angiodysplasia).

• B. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast (3%)

C. Hemorrhoidectomy (9%)

The next step in evaluation includes thorough endoscopic evaluation to identify the source of bleeding. Although this patient had a normal screening colonoscopy 6 years ago, new-onset anemia with a positive FOBT warrants diagnostic colonoscopy again to investigate for pathology sources. Upper endoscopy is also generally recommended because additional sources of bleeding may be present (eg, 10% of OGIBs have simultaneous lesions in the upper and lower GI tracts). If both studies are negative, small bowel evaluation (eg, video capsule endoscopy, deep enteroscopy) may be required.

• D. Oral iron therapy and periodic blood count (8%)

E. Tagged red blood cell scan (2%)

• F. Topical hydrocortisone cream (3%)

(Choice B) CT scan can be used to stage Gl cancer diagnosed by endoscopic evaluation. However, it is less sensitive for detecting small, intraluminal lesions and therefore is an inappropriate ﬁrst step in diagnosing the source of OGIBs.

(Choices C and F) Hemorrhoids may periodically bleed (typically with visible red blood per rectum, not seen in this patient) and therefore could contribute to a positive FOBT. Because hemorrhoidal bleeding is typically insufﬁcient to cause iron deﬁciency anemia, the presence of anemia should raise concern for other causes of bleeding. Although symptomatic external hemorrhoids (eg, causing pruritus) can be managed conservatively (eg, topical hydrocortisone), this patient lacks hemorrhoidal symptoms; her anemia warrants thorough endoscopic evaluation.

This patient has an indurated, erythematous mass near the anal oriﬁce associated with severe, constant anal pain and a low-grade fever, a presentation most consistent with a perianal abscess. A perianal abscess occurs due to occlusion of an anal crypt gland, which allows for bacterial overgrowth.

A. Human papillomavirus infection of the anal canal (8%)

B. Infection of an occluded anal crypt gland (57%)

C. Overstretching and tearing of the anal mucosa (7%)

D. Prolapse of an internal hemorrhoid (4%)

Initially, a perianal abscess may cause pain only with defecation and mild pruritus, but as the infection progresses, the pain becomes constant and severe and can be associated with systemic manifestations such as fever. If left untreated, perianal abscesses can track into deeper structures, leading to perirectal (eg, intersphincteric) abscesses and/or systemic infection (anal sepsis). They can also progress to form anorectal ﬁstulae, a connection between the abscess and the perirectal skin or nearby organs. Early recognition followed by incision and drainage is essential to avoid such progression.

(Choice A) Human papillomavirus can be transmitted via anoreceptive intercourse and result in anogenital warts (eg, condylomata acuminata). Most warts are asymptomatic papules. Unlike this patient's lesions, they are rarely associated with pain or fever.

(Choice C) Anal ﬁssures are the result of overstretching and tearing of the anal mucosa, usually from increased rectal pressure and local trauma. They classically cause pain from tearing and hematochezia with bowel movements and appear as superﬁcial, longitudinal lacerations over the anal mucosa. They typically do not cause a ﬂuctuant mass or fever.

Version

(Choices D and E) Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line and can prolapse through the anal canal; they are most often associated with painless rectal bleeding. External hemorrhoids originate below the dentate line; they can be exquisitely painful when thrombosed, but they typically appear as dusky or purple masses. Fluctuance and fever are not expected

for either type of hemorrhoid.

Educational objective:

Occlusion of an anal crypt gland can lead to a bacterial overgrowth and perianal abscess formation. Perianal abscesses often present as tender, ﬂuctuant, erythematous masses causing progressively worsening pain. Prompt incision and drainage are necessary to prevent spread to deeper structures or systemic infection.

A 29-year-old man comes to the emergency department with persistent vomiting and abdominal pain for the last 24 hours. The pain is crampy, diffuse, and getting worse. He had a normal bowel movement 3 days ago and has no diarrhea. The emesis appears green without blood or coffee grounds. The patient has not eaten since the onset of the pain due to nausea. His temperature is 36.8 C (98.2 F), pulse is 91/min, and blood pressure is 116/75 mm Hg while sitting and 94/65 mm Hg while standing.His abdomen is distended with hyperactive bowel sounds. Percussion reveals tympany, and the patient is diffusely tender to palpation. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. Laboratory results are as follows:

This patient has a mechanical small-bowel obstruction (SBO). Vomiting caused hypokalemia and, along with decreased oral intake, resulted in dehydration and orthostasis in this patient. SBO is further categorized by anatomic location (ie, proximal versus mid/distal) or simple versus strangulated. Complete proximal obstructions are characterized by early vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and abnormal contrast ﬁlling on x-ray. Mid or distal obstructions typically present as colicky abdominal pain, delayed vomiting, prominent abdominal distension, constipation-obstipation, hyperactive bowel sounds, and dilated loops of bowel on abdominal x-ray. Simple obstruction refers to luminal occlusion; strangulation refers to loss of blood supply to the bowel wall. Patients with strangulated obstructions may have peritoneal signs (eg, rigidity, rebound) and signs of shock; fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis are late ﬁndings. This patient most likely has a simple mid or distal SBO.

Adhesions are by far the most common cause of SBO. They may be congenital in children (eg, Ladd's bands), but typically result from abdominal operations or inﬂammatory processes. This adult patient with an SBO is likely to have had abdominal surgery, such as an appendectomy.

(Choice B) Ingestion of fatty foods precipitates biliary colic and acute cholecystitis, which usually cause right upper-quadrant abdominal pain. Acute cholecystitis is accompanied by fever, leukocytosis, and occasionally abnormal liver function tests.

Which of the following historical ﬁndings would most likely be seen in this patient?

•• A. Appendectomy 6 months ago (64%)

• B. Fatty food intolerance (7%)

• C. High alcohol consumption (10%)

(Choice C) High alcohol consumption can be associated with acute pancreatitis or alcoholic hepatitis. Pancreatitis can cause an ileus (decreased bowel sounds) and a tympanic abdominal examination. However, an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio >2 is typically seen if the patient is a heavy drinker. In addition, abdominal pain in pancreatitis is usually epigastric, constant, and radiates to the back.

D. Occasional black or tarry stool (4%)

E. Recent fever and nonbloody diarrhea (7%)

F. Recent weight loss (5%)

(Choice D) Occasional black or tarry stools (ie, melena) are suggestive of a gastrointestinal bleed originating above the ligament of Treitz. The most common causes of melena in a man of the patient's age are peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, esophagitis, and Mallory-Weiss tear. Peptic ulcer disease is a rare cause of proximal but not mid-distal SBO. The other etiologies are not associated with bowel obstruction.

• Mesenteric angiography if diagnosis is unclear This patient with infective endocarditis (IE) has acute, severe abdominal pain and minimal abdominal examination ﬁndings, raising strong suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). AMl is most commonly due to abrupt arterial occlusion from either cardiac embolic events (eg, atrial ﬁbrillation, vegetation due to lE, cardiovascular aneurysm) or acute thrombosis (eg, peripheral arterial disease. In patients with IE, the mesentery is the second most common site of systemic embolization (following the neurovasculature).

AMI typically presents with sudden-onset, severe, poorly localized (visceral) midabdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Early in the course of illness, physical examination is typically unremarkable (eg, minimal, diffuse tenderness) despite the presence of severe pain; this ﬁnding is classically referred to as "pain out of proportion to the examination ﬁndings" (eg, intense pain out of proportion to minimal tenderness on examination, in this patient). Local ischemia can lead to an urge to defecate, as seen in this patient.

If bowel infarction occurs, more focal abdominal tenderness (due to local inﬂammation/infarction), peritoneal signs (eg, guarding, rebound tenderness), rectal bleeding,

A 37-year-old hospitalized man is evaluated for acute onset of intense, periumbilical abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting.He has an urge to defecate and has had 2 bowel movements since the pain began. The patient has a history of alcohol and intravenous heroin use. He was admitted 4 days ago for fever, chills, and shortness of breath and was diagnosed with acute bacterial endocarditis. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and an echocardiogram showed vegetations on the mitral valve. He is currently being treated with intravenous vancomycin. On examination, the patient appears in signiﬁcant distress and is restless. Temperature is 37.5 C (99.5 F), blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min and regular, and respirations are 18/min. The pupils are equal, round, and 3 mm in size. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A 3/6 holosystolic murmur is present over the apex. There is no S3. On abdominal palpation, minimal diffuse tenderness is present. There is no rigidity or rebound. Bowel sounds are decreased. There is no tremor. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's abdominal pain?

If bowel infarction occurs, more focal abdominal tenderness (due to local inﬂammation/infarction), peritoneal signs (eg, guarding, rebound tenderness), rectal bleeding, and sepsis can develop. Most patients have leukocytosis, elevated hemoglobin (hemoconcentration), elevated amylase, and metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis).

(Choice A) Acalculous cholecystitis often occurs in critically ill, hospitalized patients. Although abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are common, examination generally shows signiﬁcant tenderness and/or a mass in the right upper quadrant. Jaundice (due to sepsis-related cholestasis) may be present.

(Choice B) Acute pancreatitis typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain radiating to the back. Although signiﬁcant alcohol intake frequently triggers pancreatitis, most patients have intense midepigastric tenderness on examination. In addition, the presence of lE makes septic embolization with AMI more likely.

• A. Acalculous cholecystitis (1%)

B. Acute pancreatitis (4%)

• C. Alcohol withdrawal (3%)

D. Intraabdominal abscess (5%)

E. Mesenteric ischemia (56%)

• F. Opioid withdrawal (28%)

• G. Papillary muscle rupture (0%)

(Choice C) Alcohol withdrawal often presents with restlessness, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. In moderate-to-severe cases, it may also cause seizures, hallucinations, and altered mental status. Acute, severe abdominal pain is less common. In addition, most cases appear within 24 hours of cessation (not 4 days later).

(Choice D) Intraabdominal abscesses usually present with subacute fever, focal abdominal tenderness, and weight loss.

(Choice F) Opioid withdrawal often causes gastrointestinal manifestations.However. these are also usually accompanied by ﬂu-like symptoms and signs of sympathetic nervous system activation (eg, mydriasis, agitation, anxiety); bowel sounds are typically increased rather than decreased. In addition, most cases present within hours of cessation.

(Choice G) Papillary muscle rupture is a serious mechanical complication of acute myocardial infarction and is characterized by acute-onset hypotension and pulmonary edema with respiratory distress.

Educational objective:

Acute mesenteric ischemia classically presents with acute-onset, severe, midabdominal pain out of proportion to physical examination ﬁndings. Progression to bowel infarction causes focal pain, peritoneal signs, rectal bleeding, and sepsis. Risk is increased in infective endocarditis, atrial ﬁbrillation, and patients with severe atherosclerotic disease.

Management of most uncomplicated biliary cysts is complete cyst resection at the time of diagnosis due to a dramatically increased malignancy risk (eg, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer) up to 30 times greater than unaffected patients (Choice B). Patients with obstructive complications (eg, cholangitis, pancreatitis) should be treated for the acute condition ﬁrst, followed by surgical cyst resection. A roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is usually performed at the time of cystectomy to create a conduit that facilitates the ﬂow of bile. There is still a small risk for developing cancer in the remaining bile ducts after surgery, and serial laboratory testing with or without imaging is usually recommended postoperatively. (Choices A and C) Secondary biliary cirrhosis is a rare complication of untreated biliary cysts and is caused by prolonged obstruction with recurrent cholangitis, ﬁndings which are not present in this case. Although surgical resection does minimize complications associated with biliary cysts, the purpose of timely cyst resection is to decrease the risk for malignancy.

Educational objective:

Biliary cysts may be asymptomatic or present with abdominal pain, a right upper quadrant mass, and/or jaundice. All patients should undergo cyst resection to decrease the risk for malignancy (eg, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer).

normal rectal examination, this presentation is highly concerning for neonatal midgut volvulus (twisting of the small intestine), a complication of malrotation that frequently occurs in the ﬁrst month of life but may develop at any age.

The most common presentation of volvulus in an infant is bilious emesis. However, progressive intestinal ischemia and necrosis can lead to rapid clinical deterioration, as seen in this patient, with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (eg, hematochezia, hematemesis) or hypovolemic and/or septic shock. Patients may have signs of peritonitis due to intestinal

perforation.

For neonates with suspected volvulus (eg, bilious emesis, x-ray with dilated loops of bowel, normal rectal examination) who are hemodynamically stable, upper Gl series (consisting of x-rays with contrast material for improved visualization) is the diagnostic gold standard. In contrast, in a neonate with bilious emesis who is hemodynamically unstable (eg, hypotension, tachycardia) or has peritoneal signs (eg, ﬁrm, distended, tender abdomen), like this infant, the next step in management is exploratory laparotomy. Surgical exploration should not be delayed for diagnostic or repeat imaging due to increased risk of mortality (Choices E and F). In patients with volvulus, surgery involves untwisting the volvulus to relieve the bowel obstruction and restore arterial blood ﬂow; viable bowel is ﬁxated to prevent future recurrence.

Time Spent

(Choice A) Contrast enema can be performed for suspected Hirschsprung disease (HD) or intussusception, both of which can cause bilious emesis and signs of intestinal perforation. However, rectal examination in HD typically shows an expulsion of stool and gas due to distal obstruction relief, and birth history often reveals delayed passage of meconium. Intussusception typically presents in children age 6-36 months; this patient's age makes this diagnosis extremely unlikely.

version

(Choices B and D) CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and Gl endoscopy can help to identify a source of Gl bleeding (eg, polyps, malignancy, irritable bowel disease) in older children and adults but are avoided when possible in infants due to the risks associated with radiation and anesthesia. More important, this patient's ﬁrm abdomen, lethargy, and tachycardia are concerning for perforation, making surgical intervention the priority over diagnostic testing.

Surgical exploration should not be delayed for diagnostic or repeat imaging due to increased risk of mortality (Choices E and F). In patients with volvulus, surgery involves untwisting the volvulus to relieve the bowel obstruction and restore arterial blood ﬂow; viable bowel is ﬁxated to prevent future recurrence

(Choice A) Contrast enema can be performed for suspected Hirschsprung disease (HD) or intussusception, both of which can cause bilious emesis and signs of intestinal perforation. However, rectal examination in HD typically shows an expulsion of stool and gas due to distal obstruction relief, and birth history often reveals delayed passage of meconium. Intussusception typically presents in children age 6-36 months; this patient's age makes this diagnosis extremely unlikely.

(Choices B and D) CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and Gl endoscopy can help to identify a source of Gl bleeding (eg, polyps, malignancy, irritable bowel disease) in older children and adults but are avoided when possible in infants due to the risks associated with radiation and anesthesia. More important, this patient's ﬁrm abdomen, lethargy, and tachycardia are concerning for perforation, making surgical intervention the priority over diagnostic testing.

Bilious emesis in a neonate with hemodynamic instability or peritoneal signs (eg, rigid abdomen) warrants emergency exploratory laparotomy. Malrotation with midgut volvulus, which can cause intestinal perforation and necrosis, should be considered in patients who also have a normal rectal examination and air-ﬂuid levels on x-ray.

A 65-year-old man comes to the office due to 4 weeks of persistent epigastric pain and

nausea. The pain is constant and does not improve or worsen with activities, position, or diet. The patient lost approximately 4.5 kg (9.9 lb) over this period. He has no fever, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 6 months ago, which is controlled with a low-carbohydrate diet. The patient has never had surgery and has no other chronic medical conditions. He has a 45-pack-year history of smoking. He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Temperature is 36.5 C (97.7 F), blood pressure is 122/72 mm Hg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 16/min. BMI is 24 kg/m?. Mucous membranes are moist. No lymphadenopathy is present in the cervical or axillary chains. Bowel sounds are present, and the abdomen is soft with mild epigastric tenderness to deep palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly or shifting dullness is present. The remainder of the examination is normal. Complete blood count, serum chemistry, and liver function studies is all normal except a fasting blood sugar of 130 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

This patient's older age, weight loss, constant epigastric pain, smoking history, and recent diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) raise strong concern for pancreatic cancer, the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Major risk factors include cigarette smoking, chronic pancreatitis, and disorders of glucose metabolism such as insulin resistance and DM.

Approximately 25% of patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed with DM <2 years prior to discovery of the tumor. In particular, atypical DM (eg, DM presenting in a thin, older patient) should raise suspicion for pancreatic cancer, particularly when accompanied by other suggestive ﬁndings (eg, pain, weight loss). It is unclear whether DM promotes carcinogenesis or whether DM occurs as a consequence of a paraneoplastic syndrome from adrenomedullin secretion, leading to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction.

Screening for pancreatic cancer is not recommended in adults with new-onset diabetes because the incidence of DM is much greater than pancreatic cancer. However, those who have symptoms of pancreatic cancer such as gnawing, constant epigastric pain and weight loss require further evaluation with CT scan of the abdomen. Abdominal ultrasound is used in the initial evaluation of patients with painless jaundice, anorexia, or weight loss. However, it is not the preferred modality for screening patients who have abdominal pain without jaundice; it often misses smaller (potentially resectable) tumors; and it does not delineate tumor extension as well as CT does (Choice A).

(Choices C and E) Patients with gastric/duodenal ulcers or gastric tumors often have gnawing epigastric pain that is worse several hours after meals (when the food buffer is cleared). These conditions are generally diagnosed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy followed by Helicobacter pylori stool antigen testing. However, peptic ulcers rarely cause constant epigastric pain or weight loss. Gastric cancer typically causes anemia (due to tumor bleeding into the stomach) and is not linked to recent-onset diabetes mellitus.

(Choice D) A nuclear gastric emptying scan can diagnose gastroparesis, which is common in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and generally presents with postprandial bloating, nausea, and early satiety. Constant abdominal pain would be atypical, and this patient's diabetes mellitus is controlled with diet.

The injury pattern of pedestrians struck by motor vehicles often includes lower-extremity trauma (from bumper impact) accompanied by thoracic trauma (# head/upper extremity trauma from rolling onto the hood). Blunt thoracic trauma can rapidly increase intraesophageal pressure enough to rupture the esophagus. This patient has turbid green drainage (gastrointestinal contents) into his chest tube following blunt chest trauma, most consistent with esophageal perforation (EP).

Version

EP may present with severe chest pain (easily missed if attributed to concurrent chest injuries [eg, rib fractures]) and symptoms/signs related to leaked esophageal air (eg, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema) or gastrointestinal ﬂuid (eg, pleural effusion). These manifestations may not be immediately evident until content (eg, pleural ﬂuid) accumulation increases. If pleural ﬂuid analysis is performed in the setting of EP, it typically shows low pH and high salivary amylase and may show food particles.

Management includes emergent surgical consultation, restriction of all oral intake, and intravenous antibiotic and proton pump inhibitor administration.

(Choice A) Bronchopleural ﬁstula can occur following chest trauma but is most common following lung resection. The abnormal ﬂow of inhaled air into the pleural space would cause persistent air leak into the chest tube drainage system rather than green ﬂuid.

• A. Bronchopleural ﬁstula (20%)

B. Diaphragmatic rupture (24%)

C. Esophageal perforation (44%)

(Choice B) Diaphragmatic rupture can occur after blunt thoracoabdominal trauma due to a sudden and unequal increase in pressure. However, chest x-ray typically reveals elevated hemidiaphragm or migration of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity rather than pleural

effusion.

D. Hemothorax (4%)

E. Pulmonary infarction (6%)

(Choice D) Blunt chest trauma may cause hemothorax if lung parenchyma or intercostal vessels (eg, rib fractures) are injured. Hemothorax appears on chest x-ray as a pleural effusion; however, drainage would be bloody, not green.

version

This patient has small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), presenting with chronic abdominal bloating, excessive ﬂatulence, and nonbloody diarrhea. The proximal small intestine normally contains minimal bacterial colonization due to gastric acidity and peristalsis; however, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures create a blind loop of intestine that allows for excessive bacterial growth. Conditions that alter intestinal motility (eg, systemic sclerosis, diabetes mellitus), anatomy (eg, strictures), or gastric/pancreatic secretions (eg, atrophic gastritis, chronic pancreatitis) also predispose to SIBO.

Patients typically develop bloating, ﬂatulence, abdominal discomfort, and watery diarrhea; in severe cases, malabsorption and weight loss are seen. Laboratory studies are frequently normal but may demonstrate nutritional deﬁciencies (eg, vitamin B12, fat-soluble vitamins) and macrocytic anemia. In contrast, folic acid and sometimes vitamin K may be elevated due to increased production from enteric bacteria.

This patient with nausea, dysphagia, chest pain, and a retrocardiac air-ﬂuid level on chest imaging likely has a paraesophageal hiatal hernia (PEH).

Hiatal hernias occur when intraabdominal organs protrude into the thoracic cavity.

Most (>90%) hiatal hernias are sliding hernias, which occur when the gastroesophageal junction and proximal stomach slide into the chest. Sliding hernias are usually asymptomatic or result in reﬂux symptoms (eg, heartburn).

In contrast, PEHs occur when the gastric fundus migrates into the thoracic cavity; larger

defects can result in the subsequent herniation of the surrounding stomach and intraabdominal organs (eg, bowel, spleen). This results in compression of the stomach and surrounding organs (eg, esophagus, lungs), leading to more severe symptoms. Common manifestations

organs (eg, esophagus, lungs), leading to more severe symptoms. Common manifestations include nausea and vomiting, postprandial fullness, dysphagia, and epigastric and/or chest pain. As the stomach advances into the thoracic cavity, there is risk of respiratory compromise and gastric volvulus.

The presence of a retrocardiac air-ﬂuid level (due to the stomach bubble within the thoracic cavity) suggests a PEH, although it may also be seen in sliding hernias. The diagnosis is conﬁrmed with barium swallow or upper endoscopy. Whereas symptomatic sliding hernias are generally managed with medical treatment of reﬂux symptoms, PEHs often require surgical

repair.

• A. Degeneration of esophageal ganglion cells (15%)

(Choice A) Achalasia results from the degeneration of esophageal ganglion cells, leading to tonic contraction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Patients have dysphagia, but regurgitation of undigested food is typical. In addition, retrocardiac air-ﬂuid levels would not occur.

B. Esophageal metaplastic and dysplastic changes (4%)

C. Gastric herniation into the thoracic cavity (66%)

D. Laxity of the lower esophageal sphincter (6%)

E. Weakness of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles (7%)

(Choice B) Barrett esophagus is characterized by intestinal metaplasia, which can become dysplastic and progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Although hiatal hernias increase the risk for this condition because of recurrent gastroesophageal reﬂux, Barrett esophagus itself does not cause dysphagia or a retrocardiac air-ﬂuid level.

(Choice D) Laxity of the LES can predispose to gastroesophageal reﬂux, which can cause chest discomfort and nausea but also typically results in heartburn and regurgitation of acidic material. However, a retrocardiac air-ﬂuid level would be unexpected.

(Choice E) Weakness of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles in Killian triangle results in Zenker diverticulum. Although this causes oropharyngeal dysphagia, it is much more common in the elderly and typically associated with halitosis. Air-ﬂuid levels may be present in the diverticulum (located in the upper esophagus), not the thoracic cavity.

Educational objective:

Paraesophageal hiatal hernias occur when the gastric fundus migrates into the thoracic cavity; large defects can result in herniation of the surrounding stomach and intraabdominal organs. Manifestations include nausea and vomiting, postprandial fullness, dysphagia, and epigastric and/or chest pain. Chest imaging typically reveals a retrocardiac air-ﬂuid level within the thoracic cavity.

A 54-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to shortness of breath. Over

Explanation

the past 2 weeks he has had progressively labored breathing that now occurs even at rest. He has had no chest pain, cough, fevers, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, or weight changes. The patient does note frequent "attacks" of epigastric pain for the past 10 years, which occur twice a month and last a few days at a time. Medical history is signiﬁcant for alcohol withdrawal seizures; the patient has consumed 7 or 8 beers a day for the past 20

years. Temperature is 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate is 95/min, and respirations are 23/min; oxygen saturation is 92% on 4 L oxygen by nasal cannula. Physical examination shows

decreased breath sounds on the left side along with dullness to percussion. The abdomen is tender to palpation in the epigastrium without rebound or guarding. Extremities are warm and well perfused without edema or clubbing. Chest x-ray reveals a large, left-sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis results in removal of 1.5 L of ﬂuid.

Fistulas involving the pleural cavity enable pancreatic ﬂuid to enter the pleural space. The resultant pleural effusion is exudative by Light criteria and amylase-rich (ie, pleural ﬂuid amylase exceeding upper limit of normal for serum amylase or a pleural-ﬂuid-to-serum-amylase ratio >1).

PPFs tend to recur after thoracentesis. Management includes bowel rest to avoid pancreatic stimulation, enabling the PPF to close. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and/or stent placement may be required to promote drainage of pancreatic ﬂuid through the ampulla of Vater instead of the ﬁstula. Refractory cases require percutaneous drainage or surgery.

(Choice A) In patients with cirrhosis, a unilateral pleural effusion (eg, hepatic hydrothorax) can develop but is generally right-sided and transudative and would not exhibit high amylase levels. (Choice B) Heavy alcohol use can result in a dilated cardiomyopathy, and volume overload would typically result in bilateral, transudative pleural effusions.

• E. Pancreatic ﬁstula (57%)

(Choices C and F) Empyema and pulmonary tuberculosis are exudative processes; however, both typically result in a low pH (<7.30) and a markedly elevated amylase is unexpected. Tuberculous effusions also typically demonstrate an elevated adenosine deaminase level.

Educational objective:

A pancreaticopleural ﬁstula (between the pancreatic duct and the pleural space) resulting in an amylase-rich exudative pleural effusion occurs most commonly as a result of acute or chronic pancreatitis. Management includes bowel rest to promote ﬁstula closure; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography may be required.

abdominal pain, nausea, and an episode of nonbilious emesis over the past 4 hours. The patient states severe and sharp pain abruptly began in her chest and progressed to the epigastric region, and the pain radiates to her back. Medical history includes Turner syndrome, obesity, and hypertension. She does not use tobacco or recreational drugs; she drinks 3-5 alcoholic beverages per week. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 160/94 mm Hg, and pulse is 110/min. On physical examination, the lungs are clear and heart sounds are normal. There is mild abdominal tenderness, especially in the upper abdomen, and bowel sounds are decreased. ECG demonstrates sinus tachycardia but is otherwise normal. Laboratory studies reveal leukocytosis with elevated bands, normal serum troponin, and an elevated serum amylase level.

Abrupt-onset, severe chest pain that migrates to the epigastric region and radiates to the back in a patient with Turner syndrome and hypertension raises concern for acute aortic dissection. Turner syndrome (absence of an X chromosome [45,X]) is associated with an increased incidence of bicuspid aortic valve and aortic coarctation, and a 12-fold increased risk for aortic dissection.

Complications of aortic dissection arise from extension of the dissection into branches of the aorta. This patient's dilated bowel loops and mild abdominal tenderness out of proportion to severe abdominal pain suggest intestinal ischemia due to extension of the dissection into a mesenteric artery.

(Choice A) A contrasted small bowel follow-through can be used to evaluate for small bowel obstruction (SBO). However, SBO typically causes colicky abdominal pain (rather than chest and abdominal pain radiating to the back). It also is more likely to present with bilious vomiting.

A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms began 2 months ago, at which time the pain was intermittent and located in the right lower quadrant. Since then, it has progressed and is now diffuse, severe, and unremitting. The patient started vomiting bilious ﬂuid 2 days ago but has not had hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, or unexpected weight loss. In addition, he has not moved his bowels in 2 days, although he frequently passes ﬂatus. Medical history is signiﬁcant for Crohn disease with ileal involvement, which is currently managed with inﬂiximab and has never required surgery. The patient has used acetaminophen and ibuprofen to relieve his pain and has not used narcotics. He smokes 3-4 cigarettes a day but does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Temperature is 37.5 C (99.5 F), blood pressure is 134/78, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical examination, the patient is awake and cooperative. Chest examination is unremarkable. The abdomen is distended, tympanic, and tender to palpation; there is no rebound tenderness or guarding. Which of the following most likely explains this patient's presentation?

Explanation

This patient with Crohn disease most likely has small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to a ﬁbrotic stricture. Strictures are a complication of Crohn disease that result from poorly controlled, severe inﬂammation. Smoking and young age (<30) at diagnosis are signiﬁcant risk factors for uncontrolled inﬂammation and disease progression despite medical therapy.

SBO due to ﬁbrotic stricture typically presents with bilious vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and either partial (ie, ability to pass gas but not stool) or complete (ie, inability to pass ﬂatus or stool) obstruction. Abdominal examination commonly reveals distension and high-pitched (tympanic) bowel sounds.

Although medical treatment for Crohn disease (eg, inﬂiximab) can reduce inﬂammation and may help prevent ﬁbrotic stricture development it cannot resolve a stricture once one develops. Depending on the location and length of the stricture, surgical resection may be required.

• A. Adverse reaction to inﬂiximab (0%).

B. Adynamic ileus (16%)

• C. Clostridioides difﬁcile infection (0%)

D. Fibrotic intestinal stricture (68%)

(Choice A) Inﬂiximab and other tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists (eg, adalimumab) are commonly used to treat Crohn disease. They are usually well tolerated but can increase a patient's risk for infection and malignancy. Gastrointestinal distress is not a typical adverse effect.

E. Intestinal malignancy (0%)

• F. Toxic megacolon (13%)

(Choice B) Adynamic ileus occurs when small bowel motility is disrupted, leading to intestinal dilation, obstipation, and bilious emesis. Although it presents similarly to SBO, dynamic ileus only develops after exposure to an insult that "stuns" the bowel, such as recent intra-abdominal surgery or high-dose opioids.

Abdominal CT scan with oral or rectal contrast can conﬁrm the diagnosis by showing contrast material in the bladder with thickened colonic and vesicular walls; intravenous contrast should not be used because the contrast agent is normally excreted into the urine and will obscure the diagnosis. Colonoscopy is usually subsequently recommended in patients with colovesical ﬁstula to exclude colonic malignancy. Treatment typically requires surgery.

The patient has a long history of straining on urination and a weak urine stream and is currently being treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Four weeks ago, he was seen in the emergency department for persistent lower quadrant abdominal pain and diagnosed with acute diverticulitis. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.7 F), blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, and pulse is 72/min. The abdomen is soft and mildly tender in the left lower quadrant. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Rectal examination shows a smooth, enlarged, nontender prostate. Laboratory studies show normal complete blood count and serum chemistries, including serum creatinine. Urinalysis is positive for numerous white blood cells and bacteria. Urine culture grows Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. What is the most appropriate next step in

Cecal volvulus forms a closed-loop obstruction. With continued gas formation by intraluminal bacteria, the lumen of the obstructed bowel loop gradually expands. This leads to slowly progressive (eg, over 2 days) abdominal distension and discomfort frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting. As in this patient, abdominal x-ray may reveal a large, dilated colonic loop. However, plain radiographs are diagnostic less often in cecal than in sigmoid volvulus, so abdominopelvic CT scan is typically performed.

Treatment is emergency laparotomy and resection of the volvulized colonic segment (eg, right colectomy). Endoscopic detorsion is not advised (success rate: <5%-20%). This contrasts with the management of sigmoid volvulus, in which endoscopic detorsion is the ﬁrst-line treatment (success rate: >75%-90%) prior to elective, rather than emergency, sigmoid colectomy.

(Choice B) Gastric outlet obstruction (eg, due to malignancy) can cause abdominal distension and pain; however, x-ray typically reveals an enlarged gastric bubble with decompressed bowel

distally.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Cecal volvulus (74%)

B. Gastric outlet obstruction (5%)

C. Ileocolic intussusception (3%)

D. Paralytic ileus (5%)

E. Toxic megacolon (11%)

(Choice C) Ileocolic intussusception (prolapse of the ileum into the colon) can cause selfresolving episodes of abdominal pain and vomiting. However, because the mechanical obstruction occurs in the distal small bowel (ie, ileum), x-ray typically reveals multiple, dilated small-bowel loops with air-ﬂuid levels.

(Choice D) Paralytic ileus (intestinal obstruction due to dysfunctional peristalsis) typically causes generalized distension of the large and small bowel on x-ray.

(Choice E) Toxic megacolon can cause colonic dilation on x-ray. However, x-ray typically reveals diffuse dilation of the colon within its normal anatomic arrangement rather than a single, dilated colonic loop, as in cecal volvulus. In addition, patients typically appear toxic (eg, fever, altered sensorium) and often have bloody diarrhea.

A 50-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with 2 days of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.The pain was initially intermittent, coming in waves, but over the past 6 hours it has become severe and continuous. She has vomited 3 times over the last several hours but has not passed gas or had a bowel movement for the last 3 days. The patient's medical history is notable only for a large benign ovarian cyst, which was removed 10 years ago. Temperature is 38.5 C (101.3 F), blood pressure is 91/64 mm Hg, pulse is 122/min, and respirations are 24/min. Pulse oximetry shows 97% on room air. Mucous membranes are dry. Cardiopulmonary examination shows tachycardia but no abnormalities. The abdomen is distended, tympanic, and tender to palpation in all 4 quadrants. There is mild guarding and bowel sounds are decreased. Digital rectal examination shows no stool in the rectal vault. Laboratory results are as follows:

/ • F. Urgent surgical exploration (53%)

• Surgical exploration for signs of complications This patient's presentation is consistent with complicated small-bowel obstruction (SBO). Patients with SBO typically present with colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, inability to pass ﬂatus or stool, abdominal distension, and diffuse tenderness. A history of prior abdominal surgery is an important risk factor due to adhesion development. Increased pain and hyperactive bowel sounds are sometimes noted during a peristaltic rush; however, as the SBO progresses, sounds may become diminished and if ischemia occurs they may disappear altogether. Depending on the level of obstruction, abdominal radiographs can reveal dilated loops of bowel with multiple air-ﬂuid levels. Mild leukocytosis and amylase elevation can also

be seen.

Most patients with SBO can be managed initially with conservative measures (eg, bowel rest, nasogastric tube suction, correction of metabolic derangements). However, this patient has several ﬁndings that indicate a complicated SBO with increased risk of impending ischemia, strangulation, and necrosis, warranting emergency abdominal exploration. These ﬁndings include changes in the character of the pain, fever, hemodynamic instability (hypotension,

These ﬁndings include changes in the character of the pain, fever, hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia), guarding, leukocytosis, and signiﬁcant metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate in this patient). Delay in surgery may lead to perforation and signiﬁcant risk of mortality.

(Choice A) Antibiotics should not be used in patients with uncomplicated SBO. Patients (such as this one) who have a complicated SBO with suspected strangulation have increased risk of intestinal bacterial translocation and sepsis; broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce infection risk. However, antibiotics and observation (with serial x-rays) alone would not be appropriate for this patient given her clinical deterioration (eg, worsening pain, fever, acidosis).

and right shoulder pain for 2 hours. The patient also had an episode of emesis. When asked about her diet, she explains that she unintentionally fasted all day and had a cheeseburger 2 hours ago. The patient had a similar episode last month but did not seek medical attention as it was less severe and resolved spontaneously in a few hours. Her past medical history is signiﬁcant for heartburn, and she takes famotidine. On examination, the patient's abdomen is soft and nontender. About 4 hours after the pain began, it resolves completely. Which of the following best explains this episode?

A. Acid hypersecretion and mucosal irritation (16%)

B. Fat necrosis (0%)

C. Hollow organ contraction and outlet obstruction (70%)

D. Outlet obstruction and mucosal inﬂammation (8%)

This is the classic presentation of biliary colic secondary to gallstones. Ingestion of a large (usually fatty) meal stimulates gallbladder contraction. The intra-gallbladder pressure increases on gallbladder contraction against an obstructed cystic duct and causes pain. Subsequent gallbladder relaxation allows the stone to fall back from the duct with subsequent pain resolution. The pain is in the right upper quadrant or epigastric region, often constant, and accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and right-sided shoulder or subscapular discomfort (referred pain). Patients may have recurrent symptoms that resolve between episodes. Features that distinguish biliary colic from cholecystitis are pain resolution within 4-6 hours and absence of abdominal tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis.

• E. Peritoneal irritation (2%)

• F. Vascular obstruction (1%)

(Choice A) Epigastric discomfort is accompanied by heartburn secondary to gastric acid hypersecretion and mucosal irritation. However, pain is usually described as a burning sensation and does not radiate to the right shoulder. Dyspepsia provoked by meals is often associated with belching and early satiety. Vomiting may occur but is uncommon.

A 36-year-old woman comes to the emergency department after having severe epigastric and right shoulder pain for 2 hours. The patient also had an episode of emesis. When asked about her diet, she explains that she unintentionally fasted all day and had a cheeseburger 2 hours ago. The patient had a similar episode last month but did not seek medical attention as it was less severe and resolved spontaneously in a few hours. Her past medical history is signiﬁcant for heartburn, and she takes famotidine. On examination, the patient's abdomen is soft and nontender. About 4 hours after the pain began, it resolves completely. Which of the following best explains this episode?

(Choice A) Epigastric discomfort is accompanied by heartburn secondary to gastric acid hypersecretion and mucosal irritation.However, pain is usually described as a burning sensation and does not radiate to the right shoulder. Dyspepsia provoked by meals is often associated with belching and early satiety. Vomiting may occur but is uncommon.

(Choice B) Fat necrosis may accompany acute pancreatitis. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and constant epigastric pain that radiates to the back. Pain usually does not resolve spontaneously within a few hours.

A. Acid hypersecretion and mucosal irritation (16%)

B. Fat necrosis (0%)

C. Hollow organ contraction and outlet obstruction (70%)

D. Outlet obstruction and mucosal inﬂammation (8%)

(Choice D) In acute cholecystitis, the gallbladder mucosa is inﬂamed.The cystic duct is frequently obstructed with gallstones or sludge. Although the pain is similar to biliary colic pain in location, radiation, and associated symptoms, it usually lasts longer than 6 hours. Furthermore, patients frequently have fever, leukocytosis, and tenderness to palpation in the midclavicular line under the right costal margin (Murphy's sign).

• E. Peritoneal irritation (2%)

• F. Vascular obstruction (1%)

(Choice E) Rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding, and decreased bowel sounds are found on abdominal examination in patients with peritoneal irritation. This patient's abdominal examination is benign.

Omitted

(Choice F) Bowel ischemia from vascular obstruction causes severe abdominal pain out of proportion to ﬁndings on physical examination. The pain is often periumbilical, lasts longer than that of biliary colic, does not resolve spontaneously, and is frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and fecal blood.

Educational objective:

version

Biliary colic occurs due to increased intra-gallbladder pressure that is created when the gallbladder contracts against an obstructed cystic duct. The pain is exacerbated by fatty meals, usually lasts less than 6 hours, and resolves completely between episodes. There is no fever, abdominal tenderness on palpation, or leukocytosis.

A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain. The pain started about an hour ago after a large, fatty meal and is associated with nausea. The patient had a similar episode a week ago that resolved spontaneously. She has no vomiting or diarrhea. The patient had a cholecystectomy 2 years ago due to symptomatic cholelithiasis. Other medical conditions include hyperlipidemia and obesity. The patient does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg, and pulse is 110/min. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable except for tachycardia. The patient has right upper quadrant tenderness to deep palpation without guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normal. Rectal examination is normal and stool is negative for blood. Laboratory results are as follows:

Leukocytes

Liver function studies Total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase 120 U/L Aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 37 U/L Alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 49 U/L

Amylase 91 U/L Abdominal ultrasonography reveals a mildly dilated common bile duct but no stones. While in the emergency department, the patient receives morphine for pain control, but the pain worsens. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Explanation

This patient likely has postcholecystectomy pain due to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction

(SOD). The sphincter of Oddi is a muscular valve containing 2 sphincters (biliary and pancreatic) that control the ﬂow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum. Either (or both) of these components can develop dysfunction secondary to the following:

• Stenosis: mechanical obstruction occurring secondary to inﬂammation or scarring (eg, gallstone passage, pancreatitis)

• Dyskinesia: functional obstruction caused by intermittent smooth muscle dysmotility (eg, spasm, impaired relaxation)

SOD, seen most often in postcholecystectomy patients, is characterized by recurrent, episodic right upper quadrant (RUQ) or epigastric pain that lasts 30 minutes to several hours, like that of biliary colic. Depending on which component (biliary, pancreatic) of the sphincter of

Oddi is involved, elevations in aminotransferases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (biliary) and/or amylase and lipase (pancreatic) may be seen.

As seen in this patient, opioid analgesics can increase sphincter contraction and precipitate or exacerbate pain. Visualization of a dilated common bile duct in the absence of stones increases the likelihood of SOD. Sphincter of Oddi manometry is the gold standard for diagnosis, and sphincterotomy is commonly the treatment of choice.

(Choice A) Bile reﬂux gastritis occurs as a result of an incompetent pyloric sphincter (eg, following gastric surgery), which allows retrograde ﬂow of bile-rich duodenal ﬂuid into the stomach and esophagus. It typically results in bilious vomiting, frequent heartburn, and abdominal pain.

• A. Bile reﬂux gastritis (5%)

• B. Choledocholithiasis (10%)

C. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (intestinal angina) (4%)

(Choice B) Choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the common bile duct) causes RUQ pain and laboratory evidence of cholestasis (eg, elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase). However, the absence of stones on ultrasonography and increased pain after morphine administration make SOD more likely in this patient.

• D. Irritable bowel syndrome (0%)

• E. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (78%)

(Choice C) Chronic mesenteric ischemia, caused by atherosclerotic narrowing of the mesenteric arteries, can present with recurrent postprandial upper abdominal pain. However,

There is mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. The remainder of the examination reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this

patient?

This patient underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which bypasses most of the stomach by creating a small gastric pouch, a gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis, and a jejunojejunal anastomosis. Weight loss results from restricting food consumption (smaller gastric pouch) and inducing malabsorption as nutrients can only be absorbed in the common limb (where food from the alimentary limb meets pancreatic enzymes/bile acids from the biliopancreatic limb).

The procedure is associated with several postoperative complications. This patient likely has stomal (anastomotic) stenosis, caused by progressive narrowing of the GJ anastomosis that leads to obstruction of gastric pouch outﬂow. This complication usually occurs within the ﬁrst year after surgery, likely due to local tissue ischemia and ulceration. Patients typically have progressive symptoms including nausea, postprandial vomiting, gastrosophageal reﬂux, and dysphagia, to the point of not tolerating liquids.Diagnosis requires visualization of the GJ anastomosis via esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), during which balloon dilation can be performed to open the narrowing. Patients sometimes require surgical revision if balloon dilation fails.

Correct answer

(Choice A) Rapid emptying of food, especially highly osmotically active simple carbohydrates (eg, corn syrup), from the gastric pouch can cause dumping syndrome due to abrupt transfer of ﬂuid from the circulatory system into the intestines. In addition to abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea, patients typically have hypotension and tachycardia accompanied by diaphoresis, lightheadedness, or syncope. None of these symptoms are present in this patient.

(Choice C) A gastric emptying scan is the test of choice for gastroparesis, which can present with postprandial pain, vomiting, and early satiety. However, recent bypass surgery renders this test inaccurate and raises suspicion for outlet obstruction that must be investigated with

EGD.

A 46-year-old woman with a history of severe obesity, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reﬂux disease undergoes laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. A gastric pouch, gastrojejunal anastomosis, and jejunojejunal anastomosis are created without intraoperative complications. In the postanesthesia care unit, the patient reports that the skin on her chest feels "crunchy" but has no chest pain. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 132/78 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient appears comfortable. Mild crepitus is present on the anterior chest and upper abdomen; it does not extend into the neck. Jugular venous pressure is normal. Heart and lung sounds are normal. The abdomen is soft and appropriately tender; surgical dressings are intact without bloody staining. Portable chest x-ray shows mild subcutaneous emphysema in the anterior thoracic soft tissues. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

Explanation

This patient who just underwent laparoscopic abdominal surgery most likely has surgical subcutaneous emphysema (SSE), a complication in which the carbon dioxide used for abdominal insufﬂation inadvertently dissects into the surrounding subcutaneous tissues. Risk factors for the development of SSE include multiple attempts at abdominal entry, BMI >35 kg/m?, higher insufﬂation pressure settings, and longer operative times (eg, >200 min).

Subcutaneous emphysema can be detected as crepitus (eg, crunching, crackling) on palpation of the soft tissues. To determine that SSE is the likely etiology, other, more dangerous etiologies of subcutaneous emphysema, including the following, should be excluded on examination and chest x-ray:

• A. CT scan of the chest (13%)

• Pneumothorax (eg, from positive pressure ventilation): Air can dissect from the intrapleural space into the subcutaneous tissues. However, it would likely be visible on chest x-ray; and lung sounds would be diminished.

• B. Esophagography with water-soluble contrast (24%)

• C. Flexible bronchoscopy (4%)

•• D. Reassurance and observation (45%)

• Tracheal rupture (eg, from endotracheal intubation): Air can dissect from the trachea into the subcutaneous tissues. However, tracheal rupture would likely also cause pneumomediastinum and often leads to bloody secretions (eg, into the endotracheal tube intraoperatively, hemoptysis postoperatively) and cough or difﬁculty breathing.

• E. Surgical reexploration of the abdomen (11%)

• Esophageal perforation (eg, from an intraoperative nasogastric tube): Air can dissect from the esophagus into the mediastinum and subcutaneous tissues.

If ﬁndings are consistent with one of these more severe complications, chest CT, esophagography, or ﬂexible bronchoscopy (to view the airway) may be indicated. In contrast, if a patient (such as this one) is comfortable, has stable vital signs, and has no other concerning ﬁndings on examination or chest x-ray, these tests are not indicated (Choices A, B, and C).

Most cases of SSE are benign and resolve within 24 hours. Therefore, reassurance and observation are appropriate. Patients are typically admitted to the hospital and monitored because hypercarbia can occur as the subcutaneous carbon dioxide reabsorbs.

A 25-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce with pain over the intergluteal region. The pain has been present for several weeks and makes him uncomfortable when he sits at his desk at work. He has also noticed intermittent swelling with mucoid discharge, which recently became blood-tinged. The patient has no fever or chills. Bowel movements are regular and he has no urinary symptoms. His medical history is signiﬁcant for an appendectomy 2 years ago. He works as a computer programmer. The patient is sexually active with a female partner. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 123/79 mm Hg, and pulse is 78/min. BMI is 34 kg/m?. Examination shows a tender mass near the tip of the coccyx that drains mucoid ﬂuid with pressure. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Explanation

This patient with subacute pain over the midline sacrococcygeal with mucoid and bloody drainage most likely has pilonidal disease (PD). PD most frequently affects individuals age 15-30, particularly young males, obese individuals, those with sedentary lifestyles or occupations, and those with deep gluteal clefts. The most common presenting manifestations include a painful, ﬂuctuant mass 4-5 cm cephalad to the anus in the intergluteal region with associated mucoid, purulent, or bloody drainage. Pain is frequently worsened by activities that stretch the overlying skin (eg, bending down).

• A. Folliculitis (4%)

B. Hidradenitis suppurativa (7%)

C. Perianal abscess (16%)

D. Perianal Crohn disease (1%)

PD develops when an edematous, infected hair follicle in the intergluteal region becomes occluded. The infection spreads subcutaneously and forms an abscess, which can rupture and create a pilonidal sinus tract. As the patient sits or stands, hair and debris are forced into the sinus tract, resulting in recurrent infections and foreign-body reactions. Treatment is drainage of abscesses and collected debris followed by excision of sinus tracts. Despite longer healing times, open closure is preferred due to decreased recurrence rates.

• E. Pilonidal disease (69%)

• F. Squamous cell carcinoma (0%)

(Choice A) Although folliculitis is part of the initial pathophysiology of PD, it most frequently presents with multiple small, pruritic pustules, not a ﬂuctuant, tender mass.

(Choice B) Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), PD, dissecting folliculitis of the scalp, and acne conglobata are members of the follicular occlusion tetrad. Patients with HS typically have multiple, recurrent, painful nodules in the axillae, inguinal folds, and perineal areas as opposed to a single, ﬂuctuant mass. Moreover, the lesions of PD are usually midline in the gluteal clefts, whereas HS can occur at any location in intertriginous areas.

However, ﬁstulas, which are the result of abscesses spreading into the soft tissues, are typically located closer to the anus and present as single or multiple openings draining purulent material.

A 25-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce with pain over the intergluteal region. The pain has been present for several weeks and makes him uncomfortable when he sits at his desk at work. He has also noticed intermittent swelling with mucoid discharge, which recently became blood-tinged. The patient has no fever or chills. Bowel movements are regular and he has no urinary symptoms. His medical history is signiﬁcant for an appendectomy 2 years ago. He works as a computer programmer. The patient is sexually active with a female partner. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 123/79 mm Hg, and pulse is 78/min. BMI is 34 kg/m?. Examination shows a tender mass near the tip of the coccyx that drains mucoid ﬂuid with pressure. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

(Choice A) Although folliculitis is part of the initial pathophysiology of PD, it most frequently presents with multiple small, pruritic pustules, not a ﬂuctuant, tender mass.

(Choice B) Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), PD, dissecting folliculitis of the scalp, and acne conglobata are members of the follicular occlusion tetrad. Patients with HS typically have multiple, recurrent, painful nodules in the axillae, inguinal folds, and perineal areas as opposed to a single, ﬂuctuant mass. Moreover, the lesions of PD are usually midline in the gluteal clefts, whereas HS can occur at any location in intertriginous areas.

(Choice C) A perianal abscess presents with fever, malaise, anal pain, and a tender, erythematous bulge at the anal verge. This patient is afebrile, and his pain and swelling are located superior to the anus over the coccyx (4-5 cm cephalad to the anus).

• A. Folliculitis (4%)

B. Hidradenitis suppurativa (7%)

C. Perianal abscess (16%)

D. Perianal Crohn disease (1%)

(Choice D) Perianal Crohn disease commonly presents with ﬁstulas, ﬁssures, or abscesses. However, ﬁstulas, which are the result of abscesses spreading into the soft tissues, are typically located closer to the anus and present as single or multiple openings draining purulent material. Fissures usually manifest as painful ulcers, which are exacerbated by defecation.

• E. Pilonidal disease (69%)

• F. Squamous cell carcinoma (0%)

(Choice F) Squamous cell carcinoma may present as a thin, erythematous plaque with well-deﬁned irregular borders and an overlying scale or as ﬁrm, indurated nodules. Drainage of purulent or bloody material is not common.

A 75-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to right-sided abdominal pain. He has also experienced progressive fatigue and an unintentional weight loss of 7 kg (15.4 lb) in the past 2 months. He previously refused to undergo colon cancer screening. Medical and family history are unremarkable. Temperature is 37.4 C (99.3 F), blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 80/min. Mucosal pallor is present.There is no palpable lymphadenopathy, and cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable.The abdomen is soft and mildly tender in the right ﬂank area. Abdominal CT scan reveals a large tumor in the right colon with near obstruction of the colonic lumen as well as a 2.1-cm mass in the right hepatic lobe. Liver biopsy of the mass conﬁrms metastatic colon adenocarcinoma. There is no evidence of other metastases. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

This patient has adenocarcinoma of the colon with metastatic spread limited to the liver.

Liver metastasis is present at the time of diagnosis in up to 25% of cases; the liver is the most common location of colon cancer metastasis because the venous system of the colon drains directly into the portal circulation, facilitating intrahepatic spread.

Whenever possible, patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon should be offered surgical

resection with curative intent. When metastatic spread is conﬁned to the liver, surgical resection of both the hepatic mass and the primary tumor can be curative, and often provides increased long-term (>5 yr) survival even when not curative. Metastatic resection is typically done without chemotherapy unless the tumor is deemed unresectable due to the size and/or number of metastatic liver lesions.

B. Chemotherapy only (9%)

• Omitted Correct answer

C. Liver transplantation (0%)

D. Palliative care only (11%)

V • E. Surgical resection (54%)

Resection of the primary tumor is also indicated, regardless of stage, for relief or prevention of obstruction in patients at risk, such as this patient with near obstruction of the lumen. (Choices A and B) Chemotherapy is commonly employed to prolong survival in patients with unresectable metastatic colon cancer. However, for patients with limited liver metastasis, it is not curative and is not preferred over surgical resection. Combined chemotherapy and radiation are used for nonoperable rectal adenocarcinoma as well as anal squamous cell carcinoma; however, radiation therapy is typically avoided in tumors proximal to the rectum because the adverse effects (eg, radiation enteritis) can be severe.

(Choice C) Although liver transplantation can help certain individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma, it is contraindicated in patients with primary nonhepatic tumors and would not be offered to this patient.

Version

(Choice D) Because surgical resection of isolated liver metastases from colon cancer is potentially curative, offering palliative care only would be advisable if the patient is too frail to tolerate an operation. Although this patient is elderly, he lacks signiﬁcant comorbidities (eg, cirrhosis, cardiopulmonary disease) that would prevent him from undergoing surgery.

A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic for evaluation of a rash. He reports that reddish

Explanation

bumps began to develop on his shins 4 weeks ago. Although painful, they are not itchy. On review of systems, he notes that his stools have become looser than normal over the past 6 months and are associated with intermittent, crampy abdominal pain. He has unintentionally lost 5 kg (11 lb) in the past month. The patient has no hematochezia, nausea, vomiting, joint pains, night sweats, or fevers. Medical and family history are unremarkable. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs.Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 113/72 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical examination reveals several 2- to 3-cm erythematous, tender, nonmobile nodules on the anterior aspect of both lower extremities. Careful skin examination reveals no other abnormalities. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation but without distension, rebound, or guarding. Which of the following most likely explains this patient's presentation?

This patient likely has erythema nodosum (EN) (eg, painful, erythematous nodules on his shins) in the setting of uncontrolled inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) (eg, chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss). The association between EN and IBD is well recognized and more commonly occurs in Crohn disease than ulcerative colitis. EN mirrors IBD disease activity, meaning that it worsens during severe IBD ﬂares and resolves as those ﬂares improve. EN presents as tender, nonpruritic, erythematous, or violaceous nodules that typically measure 2-3 cm in size. The nodules are usually located on the shins but can develop elsewhere on the legs or on the upper extremities, buttocks, trunk, or face. EN results from a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to antigen exposure. Biopsy of the nodules reveals septal panniculitis without vasculitis.

A 65-year-old woman comes to the office due to 4 weeks of progressive abdominal pain that

Explanation

is constant and worse with eating. It has caused her to eat less often, and she has noticed some weight loss. The patient has had several years of heartburn, which is relieved by over-the-counter medications. She has taken omeprazole for the last 4 weeks, but it has not improved the pain. The patient has a 10-pack-year smoking history but quit several years ago. She does not use alcohol.Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 34 kg/m?. Abdominal examination shows epigastric tenderness. Stool occult blood testing is negative. Complete blood count, liver studies, and serum chemistry are normal. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is performed and reveals mild esophagitis but no gastritis. Abdominal ultrasound shows 2 large gallstones with no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic ﬂuid, and there is no ductal dilatation. The pancreas is poorly visualized due to overlying gas. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

• A. CT scan of the abdomen (50%)

This patient has had 4 weeks of constant, progressive epigastric pain that is worse with eating. Basic laboratory evaluation, ultrasound of the biliary tree, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy are unrevealing (mild esophagitis and large gallstones with no gallbladder inﬂammation/ductal dilation are unlikely to cause weeks of persistent pain). Because the pancreas has not been adequately visualized, the best next step is to perform a CT scan of the abdomen to examine the pancreas for a mass or inﬂammation.

Pancreatic cancer is common in those with a history of smoking or alcohol abuse. It most often presents with epigastric pain that is progressive and constant and often radiates to the ﬂanks or the back. The pain is typically worse with eating and lying supine and improved by lying in a curled position. Weight loss, jaundice, and nausea also commonly occur. Diagnostic work-up begins with CT scan of the abdomen, which has high sensitivity and is far better than ultrasound for detecting small (<3 cm) tumors.

• B. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (9%)

• C. HIDA scan (7%)

D. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (11%)

E. Mesenteric angiography (15%)

• F. MR cholangiopancreatography (5%)

(Choice B) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is primarily used for suspected choledocholithiasis, which generally causes abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and laboratory abnormalities (eg, elevated transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase). This patient with normal laboratory studies and no common bile duct dilation is unlikely to have

(Choices C and D) HIDA scan is primarily used to exclude cholecystitis in patients with suggestive symptoms (eg, severe right upper quadrant pain, fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis with left shift) but no gallbladder inﬂammation or biliary obstruction on ultrasound. This patient's constant midepigastric pain with normal laboratory studies is unlikely due to gallstone disease. Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally recommended for those with biliary colic and acute cholecystitis, patients with asymptomatic gallstones do not need cholecystectomy.

(Choice E) Mesenteric angiography can diagnose chronic mesenteric ischemia, which usually presents with severe pain with eating (intestinal angina) and food aversion. However, the pain is generally intermittent. In addition, the diagnosis is usually made with CT angiography (which is noninvasive) rather than mesenteric angiography (an invasive procedure).

Patients with evidence of bowel infarction should undergo immediate operative evaluation; otherwise, diagnosis can be conﬁrmed radiologically by CT angiography. Treatment includes open embolectomy with vascular bypass or endovascular thrombolysis. In addition, patients should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and, in the absence of active bleeding, anticoagulation to reduce the risk of clot expansion.

Urinalysis is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this

patient?

(Choice B) Although acute pancreatitis (AP) may present with nausea and abdominal pain, the pain often radiates to the back. A normal lipase result makes AP much less likely as lipase is both more sensitive and speciﬁc than amylase.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is commonly due to abrupt arterial occlusion from cardiac embolic events (eg, ventricular thromboembolism). If ischemia is prolonged, patients may develop more focal ﬁndings due to infarction, perforation, or peritonitis. Laboratory studies typically show leukocytosis, elevated hemoglobin, elevated amylase, and metabolic acidosis.

The diagnosis of fecal impaction is typically apparent on digital rectal examination, although impaction in the proximal rectum may be apparent only on abdominal x-ray. Initial management includes manual disimpaction to break up the hard stool followed by enemas (eg, tap water, mineral oil) to dislodge the fecal fragments. Following acute treatment, a bowel regimen, including laxatives (eg, polyethylene glycol, lactulose) and dietary alterations (eg, increased intake of ﬂuid and ﬁber), should be instituted.

(Choice A) Loperamide slows the transit of stool through the colon, reduces the water content of the stool, and is used for symptomatic management of diarrhea. However, the primary disorder in this patient is constipation (likely due to opiates); loperamide would likely worsen the impaction and result in paradoxical worsening of fecal incontinence.

(Choice E) Anal manometry can provide information regarding anorectal neurologic dysfunction and is indicated for evaluation of chronic constipation and fecal incontinence. However, this patient's symptoms are likely attributable to known factors (ie, debilitation, opioid analgesics), and neurophysiologic studies are unlikely to add useful information. Disimpaction should be performed ﬁrst.

Esophageal perforation is most often due to instrumentation; endoscopy, particularly when performed with additional interventions (eg, biopsy, cauterization, stricture dilation), is a common cause. Patients may develop severe chest pain (and/or back pain due to the esophagus's posterior anatomical location) and systemic ﬁndings (eg, fever) within hours of the procedure. A minority have crepitus (subcutaneous emphysema) or crunching heard on auscultation (Hamman sign). Chest x-ray may reveal ﬁndings consistent with air/ﬂuid leakage into the mediastinum (eg, pneumomediastinum, widened mediastinum) or thorax (eg, pneumothorax, pleural effusion).

contrast is more sensitive but can incite a granulomatous inﬂammatory response; it is used when water-soluble contrast esophagography is inconclusive. Esophageal perforation is a life-threatening condition. Therefore, management includes emergent surgical consultation, in addition to intravenous antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors.

(Choices B and C) Severe chest pain radiating to the back and widened mediastinum on chest x-ray are concerning for aortic dissection, which CT angiogram of the chest and TEE can both diagnose. However, aortic dissection often has other associated ﬁndings (eg, new aortic regurgitation murmur, asymmetric blood pressure), and this patient's fever and recent instrumentation make esophageal perforation a much more likely diagnosis.

(Choice D) Upper gastrosophageal endoscopy is often used to evaluate for sources of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (unlikely given this patient's negative stool occult blood test). It could likely visualize the esophageal injury in this patient but is not used for initial diagnosis of esophageal perforation because air insufﬂation and instrumentation may worsen the injury.

RUQ = right upper quadrant.

Acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) is characterized by inﬂammation and distension of the gallbladder due to obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone. Typical features include pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant, fever, and leukocytosis. Palpation (or an ultrasound probe) under the costal margin at the midclavicular line may elicit tenderness, especially during inspiration (Murphy sign).

Ultrasound ﬁndings that suggest ACC include gallbladder distension, pericholecystic ﬂuid, and a thickened gallbladder wall. Because ACC involves only the cystic duct and not the common bile duct (CBD), elevations in aminotransferases, serum total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase are not expected (they may occasionally occur if gallbladder inﬂammation causes associated hepatic inﬂammation).

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the surgical procedure of choice (vs open cholecystectomy) in patients without contraindications.

This patient's migratory right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis are most concerning for acute appendicitis. A high clinical suspicion of appendicitis was historically considered sufﬁcient to proceed to appendectomy, and a negative appendectomy (ie, removed appendix was noninﬂamed on pathology) rate (NAR) of approximately 10% was deemed acceptable. However, given its widespread availability and rapidity, diagnostic imaging is now typically performed when appendicitis is suspected (eg,

modiﬁed Alvarado score ≥4). Imaging decreases the NAR and directs deﬁnitive management

For avoiding ionizing radiation exposure, abdominal ultrasound is the initial imaging modality used in children and pregnant women, and MRI may be necessary if ultrasound is nondiagnostic. However, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (with contrast) is the preferred study for evaluation of suspected appendicitis in nonpregnant adults, such as this man. CT has high diagnostic accuracy and is less likely to yield an indeterminate result (ie, nonvisualized appendix). In addition, CT is less operator dependent than ultrasound and is quicker, cheaper, and better tolerated by patients than MRI (Choices B and E).

Management can be directed by CT ﬁndings:

• Normal appendix: Evaluate for other diagnoses (avoids unnecessary appendectomy).

• Nonperforated appendicitis: Treat with antibiotics and appendectomy within 12 hours.

Which of the following diagnostic imaging studies is most appropriate prior to deﬁnitive treatment of this patient?

• • A. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (38%)

• Perforated appendicitis: Treat with antibiotics and either percutaneous drainage (for stable patients with a contained RLQ abscess [ie, contained perforation]) or emergency appendectomy (for patients with diffuse intraabdominal contamination [ie, free perforation]).

• B. MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (0%).

• C. No additional imaging (44%)

Several trials have studied antibiotic-based nonoperative management of patients with nonperforated appendicitis. Although most patients avoided appendectomy when treated with antibiotics only, there was no reliable way to predict which patients would fail treatment and which would require rescue appendectomy. At present, appendectomy remains the treatment of choice for nonperforated appendicitis.

D. Supine and lateral decubitus abdominal x-rays (0%)

• E. Ultrasound of the abdomen (16%)

A 44-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain that

Explanation

radiates to her back. The pain was sudden in onset and has remained steady for the past several hours. She has associated nausea and vomiting. Past medical history is notable for a surgically repaired femoral hernia and appendectomy as a child. The patient takes no medications and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Temperature is 37.2 C (98.9 F), blood pressure is 112/70 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 18/min. BMI is 35 kg/m?. Examination shows an agitated woman who sits leaning forward on the bed. Her skin has no evidence of icterus or excoriations. Lungs are clear to auscultation and heart sounds are normal. There is moderate tenderness in the epigastrium but no guarding, rebound tenderness, or hepatosplenomegaly. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory results are as follows:

Acute pancreatitis

• Chronic alcohol use (~40%)

• Gallstones (~40%)

• Hypertriglyceridemia

Etiology

• Drugs (eg, azathioprine, valproic acid, thiazides)

(Choices A and C) CT scan is not required to diagnose pancreatitis in patients (such as this one) with typical abdominal pain and amylase/lipase levels >3 times ULN. It can be used to conﬁrm the diagnosis and identify complications (eg, pancreatic hemorrhage or necrosis) in patients without these classic ﬁndings (eg, atypical abdominal symptoms, amylase/lipase elevation <3 times ULN). However, CT is not as sensitive as ultrasound for detecting gallstones. Plain radiographs also have a very low sensitivity for gallstones.

(Choice B) Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan (cholescintigraphy) is used to diagnose acute cholecystitis if ultrasound does not provide a clear diagnosis. It is not routinely used to evaluate pancreatitis.

Which of the following is the best next step in evaluating the underlying etiology for this patient's acute condition?

(Choice E) Viruses (eg, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster, HIV) are a less likely cause of pancreatitis in this patient. Serologic studies can be deferred unless standard testing does not identify the cause.

Gallstones and chronic alcohol abuse are the most common causes of acute pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasound is the most sensitive and speciﬁc imaging study to detect gallstones and should be performed in all patients with suspected gallstone-induced pancreatitis.

A 29-year-old woman comes to the office to establish care. The patient feels well overall but

Explanation

has had 4-5 loose bowel movements a day with mild, cramping abdominal pain.She has no weight loss, bloody stools, vomiting, rashes, or joint pain. Medical history is signiﬁcant for long-standing Crohn disease that required an ileocolectomy 3 years ago. The patient has been taking adalimumab and azathioprine since the surgery. In addition to Crohn disease, she has type 2 diabetes, morbid obesity, and generalized anxiety disorder. The patient frequently consumes fast food and rarely eats fruits, vegetables, or whole wheat bread. She has smoked both cigarettes and marijuana for the past 15 years. Temperature is 37.5 C (99.5 F), blood pressure is 132/89, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. BMI is 41 kg/m?. Oropharyngeal examination reveals moist mucosal membranes and no mouth ulcers. Heart and lung sounds are unremarkable. The abdomen has a well-healed laparoscopic scar but is otherwise nontender and nondistended. Which of the following is most strongly associated with progression of this patient's Crohn disease?

V A. Cigarette smoking (75%)

This patient has severe Crohn disease, evidenced by the prior need for surgery and her young age at the time of diagnosis. Such patients are at high risk for disease recurrence; >50% require repeat surgery within 10 years if the disease is not properly controlled. Most patients with severe Crohn disease are medically managed with biologic therapy (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors) and/or immunomodulators (eg, azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine) and require close endoscopic surveillance to ensure sustained remission.

This patient should be advised to stop smoking because it is the only major modiﬁable risk factor that affects the severity and progression of Crohn disease. Smoking is strongly associated with an increased need for hospitalizations and intestinal surgery as well as failure of biologic therapy. Other risk factors for severe disease include young age (<30 years) at diagnosis, extensive anatomic involvement, perianal disease, deep ulcerations, strictures, ﬁstulization, and prior intestinal surgery.

• B. Diabetes mellitus (9%).

• C. Generalized anxiety disorder (2%)

• D. Marijuana use (0%).

• E. Obesity (11%)

(Choices B and E) Both obesity and diabetes mellitus have been associated with colon cancer but neither increases the risk for complications related to Crohn disease. Obesity is also considered a risk factor for diverticulosis, but diabetes mellitus does not share this association.

(Choice C) Patients with Crohn disease, as well as irritable bowel syndrome, are at increased risk for mood disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder; however, concurrent mood disorders do not inﬂuence the progression or severity of Crohn disease.

(Choice D) The effect of medical marijuana on the progression of Crohn disease is unclear; therefore, it is not recommended for these patients. Furthermore, marijuana is a major risk factor for cyclic vomiting syndrome, and in the absence of a known medical beneﬁt, cessation should be recommended.

version

Educational objective:

Patients with severe Crohn disease, especially those who have required intestinal surgery in the past, are at high risk for future complications and often need aggressive management with biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy. Smoking is strongly associated with increased severity and progression of Crohn disease and should be avoided in these patients.

A 58-year-old, previously healthy man is evaluated due to a 2-month history of early satiety,

Explanation

postprandial epigastric pain and vomiting, and unintended weight loss. Physical examination shows cachexia and a palpable epigastric mass. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals a large prepyloric mass causing gastric outlet obstruction; biopsy of the mass is consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal CT scan reveals thickening of the gastric wall with adjacent fat inﬁltration, enlarged lymph nodes, and multiple hepatic metastatic lesions. The disease is considered unresectable, and the patient undergoes laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy for palliation of gastric outlet obstruction. Postoperatively, he tolerates tube feeding but experiences worsening weakness. The patient also has frequent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Laboratory results are as follows:

This patient with a malignant gastric outlet obstruction has evidence of severe malnutrition (ie, weight loss, cachexia). The development of hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, weakness, and arrhythmias after the initiation of tube feeding suggests refeeding syndrome, which occurs after the reintroduction of nutrition in patients with chronic malnourishment (eg, anorexia nervosa, malignancy).

Starvation results in the depletion of phosphate, although serum levels may remain normal due to transcellular shifts. The reintroduction of carbohydrates (ie, tube feeding) leads to increased insulin secretion. This stimulates the cellular uptake of electrolytes (ie, phosphate, potassium, magnesium) and increases phosphate utilization during glycolysis (eg, formation of ATP, 2-3 diphosphoglycerate). This eventually leads to phosphate depletion and failure of cellular energy metabolism, as well as massive ﬂuid and electrolyte shifts.

A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to 18 hours of abdominal pain and fever. The pain began suddenly after she ate dinner and drank 2 glasses of wine. It has been constant and radiates to the right shoulder blade. The patient has had similar episodes in the past, but the pain has never lasted longer than 45 minutes or been so severe. Temperature is 38.8 C (101.8 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 19/min. Heart and lung sounds are normal. Abdominal examination shows mild distension and tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium with voluntary guarding but no rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are decreased. Laboratory results are signiﬁcant for leukocytosis with a left shift. Which of the following antibiotics is most appropriate for this patient?

This patient with a history of transient postprandial right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain (likely biliary colic) now has severe, persistent, RUQ pain that radiates to the shoulder along with voluntary guarding on examination, systemic symptoms (eg, fever, tachycardia), and leukocytosis with left shift. This presentation is concerning for acute calculous cholecystitis, an inﬂammatory condition of the gallbladder that can occur when a gallstone obstructs the cystic duct.

• A. Azithromycin

B. Clindamycin

C. Piperacillin-tazobactam

D. Vancomycin

Cystic duct obstruction causes bile stasis within the proximal biliary tree, which dramatically increases the risk for secondary bacterial infection (eg, sepsis, gallbladder empyema, pericholecystic abscess). Therefore, affected patients typically receive empiric antibiotic therapy while awaiting deﬁnitive treatment with cholecystectomy. Coverage is provided for common enteric pathogens, including gram-negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family (eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter), gram-positive cocci (eg, Enterococcus), and anaerobes (eg, Clostridium). A common ﬁrst-line agent is piperacillin-tazobactam, which has excellent coverage against aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative pathogens, as well as many gram-positive pathogens.

Omitted

(Choice A) Azithromycin is active against many gram-positive cocci and some gram-negative bacteria in the Enterobacteriacee family (eg, E coli). However, it does not provide adequate coverage against enterococci, anaerobes, or most other gram-negative bacilli.

(Choice B) Clindamycin is used to treat some gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria but has little efﬁcacy against most aerobic gram-negative organisms.

Version

(Choice D) Vancomycin is used to treat serious infections caused by gram-positive organisms (eg, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus), but it does not provide coverage for any of the gram-negative bacteria frequently seen in acute cholecystitis.

Educational objective:

Acute calculous cholecystitis usually causes severe, persistent pain in the right upper quadrant, fever, and leukocytosis with left shift. Because of the high risk for secondary bacterial infection with aerobic and anaerobic enteric pathogens, affected patients typically receive empiric antibiotics while awaiting deﬁnitive treatment with cholecystectomy. Piperacillin-tazobactam is a common ﬁrst-line agent.

This patient has chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and shallow ulcerations on colonoscopy; the most likely explanation is mild ulcerative colitis (UC). UC, a chronic inﬂammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa, is often characterized clinically as either mild or moderate to severe. Mild UC is deﬁned as <4 watery bowel movements a day with intermittent hematochezia, normal inﬂammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and no anemia. Colonoscopy is needed to conﬁrm the diagnosis and usually shows inﬂammation and superﬁcial ulcerations extending from the anorectum continuously to more proximal regions of the colon.

Initial management for mild UC is with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) medications (eg, mesalamine, sulfasalazine, balsalazide), which are used for both induction and maintenance therapy. Mesalamine enemas or suppositories are preferred in patients with UC conﬁned to the rectosigmoid, whereas oral 5-ASA medications are needed for more extensive disease. Corticosteroids are typically reserved for acute disease ﬂares or severe chronic disease and can be given topically (eg, hydrocortisone enema) or systemically (eg, prednisone).

This patient's separation of the rectus abdominus muscles with protruding fat and bowel is consistent with a deep (fascial) wound dehiscence complicated by evisceration (ie, herniation of underlying abdominal organs). Additional clinical features include heavy drainage of peritoneal ﬂuid, local bulging, and a popping sensation (from fascial suture failure). Fascial dehiscence is typically seen in the ﬁrst 1-2 weeks after surgery but occasionally occurs up to 30 days postoperatively. Patients with fascial dehiscence, particularly with evisceration, require emergency surgery because the eviscerated bowel is at risk for continued herniation and strangulation.

(Choice A) Abdominal binders may be placed brieﬂy in preparation for surgery in patients with fascial dehiscence to prevent evisceration. They are contraindicated in patients with bowel evisceration because they can cause strangulation and perforation.

(Choice B) In cases of suspected wound dehiscence not apparent on examination, an ultrasound or CT scan may be indicated. This patient has visible evisceration; therefore, delaying surgery may increase morbidity and mortality risk.

Laboratory results are as follows:

Explanation

This patient has intermittent abdominal pain that radiates to the back and is worsened with eating. In association with imaging demonstrating pancreatic atrophy and calciﬁcations, this presentation is consistent with chronic pancreatitis, which occurs most commonly from long standing alcohol abuse.

The destruction of acinar and islet cells results in pancreatic exocrine insufﬁciency. Pancreatic secretion is stimulated by cholecystokinin (CCK). Normally, pancreatic enzymes breakdown CCK-releasing protein, thereby limiting CCK release. In patients with pancreatic insufﬁciency, pancreatic enzyme deﬁciency leads to the release of high volumes of CCK, resulting in a loop of pancreatic hyperstimulation. In association with pancreatic inﬂammation and ischemia, this results in the characteristic post-prandial abdominal pain common in patients with chronic pancreatitis.

conﬁrms the diagnosis.Pleural ﬂuid analysis is not required to conﬁrm EP, but if performed, typically shows low pH and very high amylase (>2500 IU/L from leaked saliva) and may show food particles. Surgical consultation should be obtained as soon as the diagnosis is made because most perforations require emergent operative debridement and repair.

(Choice A) Acute pancreatitis can cause a unilateral, left-sided, exudative pleural effusion with a high amylase concentration (due to high serum amylase levels). However, pancreatitis presents more classically as epigastric pain radiating to the back rather than chest pain and would not cause mediastinal widening on chest x-ray.

(Choice B) Severe chest pain accompanied by a widened mediastinum and unilateral pleural effusion (possible hemothorax) is concerning for aortic dissection in a patient actively using cocaine (a risk factor), as in this patient with injected conjuctivae and dilated pupils. However, aortic dissection usually has associated ﬁndings such as pulse/blood pressure variation (eg, >20 mm Hg blood pressure difference between the extremities), and fever is uncommon.

(Choice C) The patient is at risk for aspiration from protracted vomiting. Although fever, tachypnea, and pleural effusion (possible parapneumonic effusion) are concerning for aspiration pneumonia, severe chest pain is not typical, and inﬁltrates would be expected on chest x-ray. In addition, pleural ﬂuid analysis of a parapneumonic effusion would not be expected to show elevated amylase.

Pleural ﬂuid analysis may show low pH and very high amylase (>2500 IU/L). Conﬁrmation with esophagography or CT scan using water-soluble contrast should prompt emergent surgical consultation.

Explanation

lower abdominal pain and cramps accompanied by rectal urgency, bloody diarrhea, nausea, and decreased appetite. His symptoms have become more severe over the past 2 days. The patient has never traveled outside the country and has not been prescribed antibiotics recently. Temperature is 38.5 C (101.3 F), blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 15/min. The patient is ill appearing and lethargic. Bowel sounds are decreased. The abdomen is distended, tympanic to percussion, and diffusely tender to palpation; rebound tenderness and muscle rigidity are absent. Rectal examination shows marked tenderness and mucus mixed with blood in the vault. Laboratory results are as follows:

Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL Leukocytes 31,600/mm3 Platelets 398,000/mm3

Intravenous ﬂuids are started, with improvement of blood pressure to 104/58 mm Hg and pulse to 108/min. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

• E. Opioid analgesics (0%)

• F. Stool sample for ova and parasites (6%)

• G. Sulfasalazine (6%)

This patient with 6 weeks of lower abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and fecal urgency likely has undiagnosed inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, for the past 2 days, he has had worsening symptoms, abdominal distension and tenderness, leukocytosis, and systemic toxicity (eg, fever, hypotension, tachycardia). This presentation is concerning for toxic megacolon (TM), which can complicate IBD, often early in the disease (eg, initial presentation).

The diagnosis of TM requires both manifestations of systemic toxicity and radiographic conﬁrmation of colonic dilatation without evidence of mechanical obstruction. CT scan of the abdomen with intravenous and oral contrast can identify features typical of TM:

• Colonic dilatation >6 cm (diagnostic)

• Loss of normal haustral pattern

lower abdominal pain and cramps accompanied by rectal urgency, bloody diarrhea, nausea, and decreased appetite. His symptoms have become more severe over the past 2 days. The patient has never traveled outside the country and has not been prescribed antibiotics recently. Temperature is 38.5 C (101.3 F), blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 15/min. The patient is ill appearing and lethargic. Bowel sounds are decreased. The abdomen is distended, tympanic to percussion, and diffusely tender to palpation; rebound tenderness and muscle rigidity are absent. Rectal examination shows marked tenderness and mucus mixed with blood in the vault. Laboratory results are as follows:

Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL Leukocytes 31,600/mm3 Platelets 398,000/mm3

Intravenous ﬂuids are started, with improvement of blood pressure to 104/58 mm Hg and pulse to 108/min. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

CT scan can also assess for complications of TM (eg, colonic perforation or necrosis) that may require surgery.

Nonoperative management of TM is often successful and includes supportive care (eg, intravenous ﬂuids, electrolyte repletion), bowel rest and decompression (eg, nasogastric tube), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and treatment of the underlying etiology. For TM due to IBD, intravenous glucocorticoids are ﬁrst-line therapy; sulfasalazine is not used to treat TM and is initiated only after its resolution (Choice G).

(Choices A and B) Colonoscopy with biopsies may help distinguish between ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease based on gross ﬁndings or microscopic analysis and is usually one of ﬁrst tests conducted in the workup of suspected IBD. Barium enema may help visualize strictures, ﬁstulae, or mucosal ulceration in patients with IBD. However, in the presence of a dilated, inﬂamed colon (eg, TM), instillation of contrast (eg, enema) or air (eg, colonoscopy) can cause perforation; therefore, these studies are contraindicated in this patient unless imaging excludes TM or, if TM is conﬁrmed, until the patient has already begun responding to treatment (eg, less pain and fewer bloody bowel movements with glucocorticoids).

• A. Barium enema (3%)

• B. Colonoscopy with biopsies (25%)

• C. CT scan of the abdomen (36%)

• D. Emergency surgery (20%).

• E. Opioid analgesics (0%).

• F. Stool sample for ova and parasites (6%)

• G. Sulfasalazine (6%)

(Choice D) Indications for emergency surgery in TM include peritonitis on examination and colonic perforation or necrosis on imaging. This patient has no signs (eg, rebound tenderness, rigidity) of peritonitis and can undergo imaging (eg, abdominal CT scan) as the next step to determine whether a radiographic surgical indication (eg, perforation, necrosis) is present or if nonoperative management is appropriate.

(Choice E) Opioids should be avoided in patients with TM because they slow colonic motility; this can worsen colonic dilation and precipitate perforation.

(Choice F) Parasites (eg, Entamoeba histolytica), for which the stool sample tests, can cause diarrhea; however, they typically do not cause systemic toxicity and, in the absence of a travel history, are much less likely than other causes.

Educational objective:

Diagnosis of toxic megacolon requires radiographic evidence (eg, abdominal CT scan) of colonic dilation >6 cm, along with manifestations of systemic toxicity (eg, fever, leukocytosis, hemodynamic instability).

A 24-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a week of abdominal pain. It is localized in the right lower quadrant and exacerbated somewhat by motion. Over the past 2 days, the pain has radiated to the back. The patient initially had 2 episodes of vomiting and now has decreased appetite. He has no increased urinary frequency. His other medical problems include mild intermittent asthma and gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. One month ago, he traveled to Mexico for 5 days; he had no gastrointestinal symptoms during his stay. His mother was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 49. His temperature is 38.2 C (100.8 F), blood pressure is 122/77 mm Hg, and pulse is 109/min and regular. Physical examination shows moderate tenderness in the right lower quadrant, without rebound. Passive extension of the right hip with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position elicits signiﬁcant abdominal pain. Laboratory results are as follows:

Explanation

Most patients with acute appendicitis will seek medical care within the ﬁrst 24-48 hours of symptoms. Typical features include migratory (vague periumbilical to sharp right lower) abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. These patients may have signs of irritation of the parietal peritoneum (ie, rebound tenderness, involuntary guarding, abdominal rigidity) due to impending appendiceal rupture or completed rupture with diffuse peritonitis. Urgent appendectomy is indicated in these patients.

4.5 mEq/L

1.0 mg/dL Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

•• A. Appendiceal abscess (90%)

Patients who have a delayed presentation with a longer duration of symptoms (>5 days, as in this patient) often have appendiceal rupture with a contained abscess. These patients will generally have signiﬁcant fever and leukocytosis, but ﬁndings on anterior palpation of the abdomen may be unrevealing. In such cases, maneuvers that assess the deep abdominal spaces (eg, psoas sign, obturator sign, rectal examination) may be more informative. In particular, the psoas sign suggests the presence of an abscess posterior to the appendix adjacent to the psoas muscle (or possibly an unruptured retrocecal appendix).CT imaging can conﬁrm the diagnosis in these cases. Patients with a contained appendiceal abscess have a very high complication rate from immediate surgery due to the mass of inﬂamed, infected, and friable debris and adhesions. If they are otherwise clinically stable, these patients should be managed with intravenous antibiotics, bowel rest, and possibly percutaneous drainage of the abscess. They can return in 6-8 weeks for appendectomy on an elective basis ("interval appendectomy").

• B. Colonic malignancy (0%)

• C. Complicated pyelonephritis (1%)

• D. Inﬂammatory bowel disease (1%)

• E. Parasitic colitis (7%).

(Choice B) Colonic malignancy is possible given this patient's family history, but is rare in his age group. Colon cancer more typically presents with anemia, constipation, and weight loss.

(Choice C) Complicated pyelonephritis typically presents with fever, ﬂank pain, and dysuria. Physical examination usually does not show the psoas sign, which is seen in this patient. (Choice D) Besides fever and abdominal pain, inﬂammatory bowel disease usually presents with prolonged episodes of diarrhea, which this patient does not have. Patients with ulcerative colitis typically also have gross rectal bleeding.

An 82-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to severe abdominal pain and vomiting. She has been feeling "unwell" with nausea and decreased appetite for the past 5 days. The patient describes several mild, self-resolving episodes of vomiting, abdominal bloating, and cramps during that time. She attributed her symptoms to a "stomach virus" and did not seek medical attention. Her past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, mitral valve prolapse, osteoarthritis, gallstones, and constipation.She was treated medically for diverticulitis 2 years ago without recurrence. The patient has no known drug allergies. Her temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 108/68 mm Hg, pulse is 106/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination reveals an anxious and obese woman. Cardiopulmonary examination reveals a late systolic click but is otherwise unremarkable. Her abdomen is soft but distended with hyperactive bowel sounds. There is no evidence of icterus. Laboratory workup is signiﬁcant for a leukocyte count of 11,000/mm? and mild elevation of liver transaminases. Abdominal x-ray shows dilated loops of small bowel and air in the intrahepatic bile ducts. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Explanation

This patient with stuttering episodes of nausea and vomiting, pneumobilia (air in the biliary tree), hyperactive bowel sounds, and dilated loops of bowels likely has a gallstone ileus, a form of mechanical small bowel obstruction.Gallstone ileus occurs when a gallstone passes through a biliary-enteric ﬁstula into the small bowel. As the stone advances it may cause intermittent "tumbling" obstruction with diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting until ﬁnally lodging in the ileum, the narrowest section of the bowels, several days later.

In addition to experiencing colicky pain and vomiting, patients may report distension and inability to pass ﬂatus or stool and show signs of hypovolemia (eg, hypotension, tachycardia). Stones can occasionally also lodge in the stomach, jejunum, or colon. Cholecystitis, which predisposes to biliary-enteric adhesions, is the most important risk factor, and patients are more commonly elderly women, which reﬂects their higher prevalence of gallstone disease.

• A. Acute bowel ischemia (5%)

• B. Diverticulitis (1%)

• C. Emphysematous cholecystitis (33%)

• D. Mechanical bowel obstruction (56%)

• E. Pancreatic cancer (1%).

• F. Peptic ulcer perforation (1%)

Diagnosis can be conﬁrmed by abdominal CT scan, which may reveal gallbladder wall thickening, pneumobilia, and an obstructing stone. Treatment is surgical and involves removal of the stone and either simultaneous or delayed cholecystectomy.

(Choice A) Acute intestinal ischemia typically results in diminished bowel sounds and frequently presents with severe abdominal pain despite a relatively normal physical examination. It would also not account for the pneumobilia.

(Choice B) Diverticulitis is also common in this patient's age group, but is more likely to present with left lower quadrant pain and fever.

(Choice C) Emphysematous cholecystitis (gallbladder wall infection due to gas-producing organisms) is more commonly characterized by fever and right upper quadrant pain and can also cause ileus (decreased or absent bowel sounds). This patient has hyperactive bowel

• Topical anesthetics & vasodilators (eg, nifedipine, nitroglycerin) This patient has an anal ﬁssure causing pain and rectal bleeding on defecation. Anal ﬁssures are characterized by longitudinal tears in the anal canal distal to the dentate line and are most common at the posterior midline. Spasm of the sphincter contributes to the pain and creates tension across the wound, leading to a chronic ﬁssure. Most ﬁssures are related to chronic constipation with high anal pressures and passage of hard stools. They can also be seen with frequent diarrhea or anal sexual intercourse. In some cases, the pain may be so severe that patients withhold bowel movements, exacerbating the constipation. Chronic ﬁssures can also be accompanied by an external skin tag (sentinel pile) at the distal end.

Initial treatment of anal ﬁssures includes dietary modiﬁcation (eg, high-ﬁber diet, increased ﬂuid intake), stool softeners, and sitz baths to increase blood ﬂow to the injured mucosa. Topical anesthetics (eg, lidocaine) can enhance comfort. In addition, topical vasodilators (eg, nifedipine, nitroglycerin) can be used to reduce pressure in, and increase blood ﬂow to, the anal sphincter, facilitating healing.

(Choices B, C, and D) Surgical intervention (eg, lateral sphincterotomy, ﬁssure excision) is indicated for ﬁssures that are refractory to medical management. Gradual dilation of the sphincter can provide a wider aperture for the passage of stool and interrupt the spasm but can lead to fecal incontinence and possible recurrent ﬁssures.

Examination may reveal hemodynamic instability, diffuse abdominal pain, and signs of peritonitis (eg, rebound, guarding). On occasion, pain may be referred from the diaphragm and phrenic nerve to the left shoulder (Kehr sign). Focused abdominal ultrasound or CT scan demonstrates free intraperitoneal ﬂuid.

Explanation

and worsening abdominal and right ﬂank pain. The day prior, he received a direct blow to the central upper abdomen during a tackle and had to sit out the rest of practice. The patient also has nausea but no emesis or diarrhea. He has no chronic medical conditions. Temperature is 39.4 C (102.9 F). Blood pressure is 100/64 mm Hg, pulse is 112/min, and respirations are 18/min. Heart and lung sounds are normal. The abdomen is diffusely tender with guarding over the epigastrium. Abdominal imaging reveals free air in the retroperitoneum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?

V • A. Duodenal tear (55%).

Approximately 1 day after sustaining blunt abdominal trauma (BAT), this patient has fever, diffuse abdominal tenderness with epigastric guarding, and retroperitoneal free air on imaging. This delayed presentation is concerning for a perforated viscus within the retroperitoneum, such as a duodenal tear.

B. Gastric rupture (5%)

C. Renal pelvis laceration (9%)

When a hollow viscus (eg, duodenum, ascending or descending colon) perforates within the retroperitoneum, gastrointestinal spillage may be initially sequestered away from the intraperitoneal space (which is separated from the retroperitoneum by the posterior peritoneal lining). This may delay the development of classic symptoms and signs of perforation (eg, fever, diffuse abdominal pain), as in this patient. In addition, back or ﬂank pain (eg, right ﬂank pain) may be present due to retroperitoneal inﬂammation.

• D. Transverse colon perforation (11%),

• E. Traumatic pancreatitis (18%)

Aspects of duodenal anatomy that increase the duodenum's susceptibility to perforation

• Its location anterior to the vertebral column: compression against the vertebral column during BAT can rapidly increase intraluminal pressure, causing rupture.

• Its multiple attachments (eg, hepatoduodenal ligament, ligament of Treitz): abrupt force against the duodenum can cause duodenal tearing at ﬁxed points of attachment rather than stretching.

Duodenal perforation is typically treated with surgical repair.

version

(Choices B and D) The stomach and transverse colon are also susceptible to rupture from rapid change in intraluminal pressure during BAT.However, both are intraperitoneal (vs retroperitoneal) structures. Therefore, intraperitoneal free air (eg, free air under the diaphragm on chest x-ray) would be expected on imaging (vs retroperitoneal free air seen in this patient). (Choices C and E) BAT can injure the pancreas or kidney, causing spillage of pancreatic enzymes or urine into the retroperitoneal space. Although both renal pelvis laceration and traumatic pancreatitis could result in a delayed presentation of abdominal and right ﬂank pain, they would typically cause free ﬂuid rather than free air on imaging.

Rapid compression of the bowel during blunt abdominal trauma can cause a perforated viscus. When viscus perforation occurs within the retroperitoneum (eg, duodenal tear), classic symptoms and signs (eg, fever, diffuse abdominal pain) may be delayed. Retroperitoneal free air may be present on abdominal imaging.

days, she had lower abdominal cramping and frequent watery diarrhea, but over the past 24

hours, the pain has progressively worsened; she has also had a fever. The patient has no chronic medical conditions but recently ﬁnished a course of ciproﬂoxacin for pyelonephritis. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, and pulse is 118/min. Abdominal examination shows lower abdominal tenderness without guarding or rigidity. Abdominal CT scan reveals colonic wall edema without perforation. The patient is admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous ﬂuids and oral vancomycin. Stool toxin assay is positive for Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile. Two days later, the diarrhea has decreased, but the abdominal pain is worsening. Examination shows an absence of bowel sounds; the abdomen is distended and diffusely tender to both palpation and release of palpation pressure. Abdominal x-ray reveals dilation of the transverse and descending colon to 10 cm. Serum lactate is 6 mmol/L (normal: <2). Which of the following is the best next step in management?

This patient with Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile infection (CDI) has worsening abdominal pain, signs of peritonitis, and severe colonic dilation (ie, toxic megacolon) despite appropriate medical management. The best next step is laparotomy to evaluate for colonic necrosis or perforation and to treat (eg, resect, lavage) the diseased colon.

CDI occurs most commonly in patients with recent antibiotic use (eg, ciproﬂoxacin) and has a wide spectrum of severity, from nonsevere disease (eg, abdominal cramping, watery diarrhea, fever) to life-threatening, fulminant colitis with toxic megacolon. This patient initially had nonsevere disease and received appropriate treatment with oral vancomycin. However, the

CDI progressed, and, now, multiple clinical indicators warrant surgical evaluation:

• Signs of peritonitis: Diffuse abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness (ie, tenderness with release of palpation pressure)

• A. Colonoscopic decompression (24%)

• B. Fecal transplantation (3%)

• C. Intravenous corticosteroids (10%)

• Colonic dilation: Megacolon (ie, colonic diameter >6 cm) on abdominal x-ray, with associated loss of smooth muscular tone (eg, decreased diarrhea)

• • D. Laparotomy (57%)

• E. Trial of neostigmine (4%)

Omitted

• Increased serum lactate: Possible marker of colonic ischemia Peritonitis often indicates bowel perforation and is a deﬁnitive indication for surgical exploration, which is performed via laparotomy (or laparoscopy in some institutions). Findings of necrosis, perforation, or abdominal compartment syndrome warrant colonic resection (ie, total abdominal colectomy).

Coagulation studies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are within normal limits.Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, including biopsies, are unremarkable. Which of the following studies is most likely to reveal this patient's diagnosis?

This patient with ﬁndings of iron deﬁciency anemia (eg, fatigue, exercise intolerance, pallor, microcytosis) has a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT), making occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding the most likely cause of his symptoms.

Patients with occult Gl bleeding, deﬁned as a positive FOBT and/or iron deﬁciency anemia without visible bleeding (eg, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia), should ﬁrst be evaluated by upper endoscopy and colonoscopy to localize the source of blood loss. When colonoscopy and upper endoscopy are unremarkable, as in this patient, small bowel pathology should be considered.

In children, the most likely cause of small bowel bleeding is Meckel diverticulum, which results from failed closure of the vitelline duct during early embryogenesis. Although most commonly seen in children age <2, it can present at an older age, including in adolescence. Secretion of hydrochloric acid from ectopic gastric tissue within the diverticulum causes intestinal ulceration, which can lead to either occult bleeding or painless hematochezia. Because the diverticulum is in the small intestine, it may not be detected on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy.

Therefore, initial evaluation of occult, small bowel bleeding in a child is often done with a Meckel scan, which uses technetium 99m pertechnetate to detect gastric mucosa. Video capsule endoscopy may also be used to evaluate occult, small bowel bleeding and can help identify angiodysplasia or neoplasia.

• B. Fecal calprotectin (13%).

C. Fecal DNA testing (5%)

• D. Technetium 99m pertechnetate scan (47%).

E. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (23%)

(Choice A) Because it detects brisk Gl bleeding, CT angiography usually misses slower occult bleeding and would therefore be less helpful for this patient. CT angiography could have been considered had this patient presented with brisk Gl bleeding (eg, hematochezia, melena, and/or hematemesis in the setting of hemodynamic instability).

(Choice B) Fecal calprotectin, a protein found within neutrophils, is typically positive in patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease, but symptoms of hematochezia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or weight loss would be expected. Colonoscopy ﬁndings of intestinal inﬂammation are also common.

ZES is due to a gastrin-producing tumor, which usually occurs in the pancreas or duodenum. Most cases are sporadic, but ZES also occurs frequently in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Uncontrolled gastrin secretion leads to parietal cell hyperplasia, with excessive production of gastric acid. Multiple duodenal (and sometimes jejunal) ulcers are typical, and the ulcers can be refractory to standard acidreducing medications. The excess gastric acid in the small intestine can cause diarrhea and steatorrhea due to inactivation of pancreatic enzymes and injury to the mucosal brush

border.

The diagnosis of ZES is suggested by a markedly elevated serum gastrin level (> 1000 pg/mL) in the presence of acidic gastric pH (<4). Endoscopy usually reveals ulcers (>90% of patients with ZES) and occasionally will identify a primary duodenal gastrinoma. CT, MRI, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy can be used to identify pancreatic tumors and metastatic disease. If gastrinoma is conﬁrmed, patients should be screened for MEN1 with assays for parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium, and prolactin.

A 45-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce with a 6-month history of recurrent, burning epigastric pain and diarrhea. His stools are frothy and unusually foul smelling and they ﬂoat. The patient's clothes ﬁt loosely, and he believes that he may have lost some weight. He has tried several over-the-counter medications, including antacids, H-2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors, with moderate success. Vital signs are normal. Examination shows no abnormalities except for midepigastric tenderness to deep palpation. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive, and stool fat is also positive. Gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals two duodenal ulcers and a jejunal ulcer. Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient's impaired fat absorption?

A. Autoimmune mucosal injury (7%)

B. Bacterial overgrowth (5%)

C. Pancreatic enzyme deﬁciency (22%)

D. Pancreatic enzyme inactivation (57%)

E. Reduced bile acid absorption (7%)

The diagnosis of ZES is suggested by a markedly elevated serum gastrin level (> 1000 pg/mL) in the presence of acidic gastric pH (<4).Endoscopy usually reveals ulcers (>90% of patients with ZES) and occasionally will identify a primary duodenal gastrinoma. CT, MRI, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy can be used to identify pancreatic tumors and metastatic disease. If gastrinoma is conﬁrmed, patients should be screened for MEN1 with assays for parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium, and prolactin.

(Choices A, B, and C) Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by malabsorption due to mucosal villous atrophy triggered by exposure to gluten-containing wheat products. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can also cause mucosal injury, possibly due to bacterial toxins. Pancreatic exocrine deﬁciency can be seen in chronic (eg, alcoholic) pancreatitis, cystic ﬁbrosis, and pancreatic resection. However, duodenal and jejunal ulcerations are not typical in these conditions.

(Choice E) Bile acids are primarily reabsorbed in the ileum; impaired absorption can cause malabsorption of fats. This is typically seen following extensive ileal resection in Crohn disease (CD), which presents with chronic or recurrent abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and weight loss. It would be unusual for CD to present with multiple duodenal ulcers.

Educational objective:

Version

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome should be suspected in patients with multiple duodenal ulcers refractory to treatment or ulcers distal to the duodenum or associated with chronic diarrhea. In these patients, inactivation of pancreatic enzymes by increased production of stomach acid may lead to malabsorption.

A 22-year-old man in the intensive care unit is being evaluated for nutritional needs.Three days ago, the patient was brought to the hospital after a severe motorcycle collision in which

he sustained traumatic brain injury as well as splenic rupture with associated vascular injury. The patient required multiple abdominal operations and ﬁnally underwent delayed fascial closure this morning. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The abdomen is mildly distended but soft; the dressing over the incision is clean and dry. Bowel sounds are decreased. Which of the following is the best next step for management of this patient's nutrition?

• • A. Enteral nutrition via feeding tube (39%)

Explanation

Due to a hypercatabolic state, critically ill patients (ie, patients in the intensive care unit [ICU]) have increased energy expenditure and protein requirements. In such patients, early nutritional support can prevent malnourishment and improve overall outcomes.

When initiated early (ie, ≤48 hr), enteral nutrition (EN) (ie, via the intestinal route) has multiple clinical beneﬁts for critically ill patients, including a reduction in infections (eg, pneumonia) and a possible reduction in mortality. EN may also help maintain gut integrity, preventing atrophy of gut- and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. EN formulas can be tailored to provide various amounts of carbohydrates (both simple and complex), protein, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes.

• B. Intermittent administration of 50% dextrose (1%).

Version

EN is typically delivered via a naso- or orogastric feeding tube; in patients with a high risk of aspiration, the tube is advanced to the postpyloric duodenum.Tube feeds can be initiated at a low rate (ie, trickle feeding) and progressively increased as tolerated by the patient. Normal bowel sounds and/or evidence of bowel function (eg, passing ﬂatus or stool) are not required for initiation of EN because they are indicative only of contractility rather than mucosal integrity and absorptive capacity.

(Choices B and C) Fifty percent dextrose is typically administered in small doses (eg, 10 mL) for reversal of acute hypoglycemia in unresponsive patients. Five percent dextrose in normal saline is a commonly used isotonic maintenance ﬂuid. Although the administration of dextrose would provide a small number of calories, both solutions lack additional nutrients (eg, protein). In addition, they would not provide the beneﬁts (eg, maintenance of gut integrity) associated with early enteral feeding.

(Choices D and E) Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) provides a complete but more elemental nutrient mixture and is typically administered via central venous catheter (vs peripheral venous catheter) because the high osmotic load is damaging to peripheral veins. However, TPN is typically used only for patients with contraindications to EN (eg, intestinal discontinuity, prolonged ileus) because early initiation may increase the risk of infection (eg, central lineassociated bloodstream infection) and lead to prolonged ICU and hospital stays.

A 49-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to 2 weeks of worsening leftsided abdominal pain, fever, and chills. The pain is constant, deep, and radiates to the back. The patient also has had decreased appetite and notes a 2.3-kg (5-lb) weight loss during this period. She has no dysuria, urinary frequency, hematuria, diarrhea, or constipation.The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy 2 weeks ago for acute calculus cholecystitis. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Temperature is 39.5 C (103.1 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 16/min. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The spleen is enlarged and tender; there is no hepatomegaly. Bowel sounds are present. The remainder of the examination is normal. Which of the following is the most

likely diagnosis?

Explanation

This patient who recently underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystitis now has high fever and tender splenomegaly, raising strong suspicion for splenic abscess, a rare, potentially life-threatening complication of bacteremia from a distant infection (eg, infective endocarditis, cholecystitis). Risk is greatest in those with immunocompromise from HIV, hematologic malignancy, or diabetes mellitus.

• A. Infected pseudocyst (8%)

• B. Infectious mononucleosis (0%)

• C. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1%).

D. Splenic abscess (73%)

• E. Splenic infarction (2%)

• F. Splenic venous thrombosis (12%)

Patients usually have persistent fever and left upper quadrant pain (sometimes radiating to the back), with or without splenomegaly. Anorexia and weight loss may also be seen. Laboratory studies will show leukocytosis with left shift, and chest x-ray frequently reveals an elevated left hemidiaphragm (and/or left pleural effusion). Diagnosis is made with CT scan of the abdomen; antibiotic therapy plus splenectomy is generally required because many patients fail percutaneous aspiration (due to the presence of occult microabscesses).

(Choice A) Pancreatic pseudocyst, a walled-off collection of ﬂuid around the pancreas following pancreatitis, is generally asymptomatic but may occasionally become infected, leading to fever and epigastric pain that radiates to the back. However, splenomegaly would be atypical, and this patient does not have risk factors for (eg, alcohol abuse) or a recent history of

pancreatitis.

A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a fall during a downhill bicycle race.The patient lost consciousness for approximately a minute and has severe back and abdominal pain. He has no other medical conditions.CT scan of the head reveals no intracranial bleeding; CT scan of the abdomen demonstrates a small retroperitoneal hemorrhage and renal laceration. Lumbar x-ray suggests a compression wedge fracture of the L2 vertebral body, and a brace is placed. The patient's renal laceration and lumbar fracture are managed nonoperatively with analgesics and supportive measures. On hospital day 3, the patient has mild, diffuse abdominal pain and nausea. The abdomen is distended, tympanic, and mildly tender without rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are absent. Upright x-ray of the abdomen is shown in the image below:

Symptoms and signs of ileus include nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, failure to pass ﬂatus or stool (obstipation), and hypoactive or absent bowel sounds. The diagnosis is clinical, but abdominal x-rays, which classically reveal uniformly dilated, gas-ﬁlled loops of bowel with no transition point, can be helpful in the conﬁrmation. Management is conservative and includes bowel rest, supportive care, and treatment of secondary causes.

(Choices A and E) The most common sites of volvulus in adults are the cecum/proximal ascending colon and sigmoid colon. Abdominal x-rays frequently reveal a transition point at the cecum or sigmoid colon. Patients are usually much older than this man and have a more insidious onset of symptoms. Neither cecal nor sigmoid volvulus is a common complication of

trauma.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

(Choice B) In complete small bowel obstruction, the bowel distal to the obstruction is not distended. In addition, hyperactive tinkling bowel sounds are typically present on physical examination. Peristaltic waves on the abdominal wall can also be observed.

(Choice C) Gastric outlet obstruction demonstrates only a distended stomach on x-ray. A succussion splash may be heard over the stomach; otherwise, bowel sounds may be normal or hyperactive.

C. Gastric outlet obstruction (9%)

D. Paralytic ileus (60%)

• E. Sigmoid volvulus (5%)

• F. Viscus perforation (6%)

Staging evaluation for rectal adenocarcinoma Tumor markers Carcinoembryonic antigen

Text Zoom

A 54-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to intermittent episodes of blood in the stool over the past several weeks. The blood is mixed in the stool, and he has also noticed bright red blood on the toilet paper. The patient reports no prior medical conditions but has not seen a physician in many years. Family history includes colon cancer in his paternal uncle. Vital signs are within normal limits.Physical examination shows a nondistended, soft, and nontender abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly. A palpable mass is present on digital rectal examination. Flexible sigmoidoscopy conﬁrms a fungating mass in the upper rectum; biopsy is consistent with adenocarcinoma.Staging CT scans reveal no lung, liver, or bony metastases. Which of the following is most appropriate prior to surgical treatment of this

patient's condition?

Explanation

Imaging

CT scan: chest, abdomen, pelvis Endoscopy/direct visualization Colonoscopy

• A. Adenomatous Polyposis Coli gene testing (1%)

• B. Colonoscopy of the entire colon (79%)

C. Endoscopy for gastric polyps (0%)

This patient has adenocarcinoma of the rectum, presenting with rectal bleeding and conﬁrmed on ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy. Sigmoidoscopy is generally well tolerated by patients and is an effective tool for evaluating lesions in the distal colon. It can also be considered for colorectal cancer screening in low-risk individuals and has been shown to reduce colorectal cancer mortality. The procedure can be performed in an ofﬁce setting by gastroenterologists and trained primary care or advanced care providers.

However, abnormal results on sigmoidoscopy often require follow-up colonoscopy. Sigmoidoscopy does not visualize beyond the rectosigmoid colon. Patients with left-sided adenomas or adenocarcinomas have increased risk for synchronous neoplasia in the right colon and therefore require visualization of the entire colon with colonoscopy (Choice D). In addition, the staging evaluation should include CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to identify distant metastasis. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels are also helpful for prognostication, although they exhibit low sensitivity and speciﬁcity for metastasis.

(Choice A) Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by mutations in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene and confers a very high risk of colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, affected individuals typically have numerous colon adenomas, not a solitary mass.

A 54-year-old man comes to the office due to intermittent episodes of blood in the stool over

the past several weeks. The blood is mixed in the stool, and he has also noticed bright red blood on the toilet paper. The patient reports no prior medical conditions but has not seen a physician in many years. Family history includes colon cancer in his paternal uncle. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a nondistended, soft, and nontender abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly. A palpable mass is present on digital rectal examination. Flexible sigmoidoscopy conﬁrms a fungating mass in the upper rectum; biopsy is consistent with adenocarcinoma.Staging CT scans reveal no lung, liver, or bony metastases. Which of the following is most appropriate prior to surgical treatment of this

patient's condition?

Sigmoidoscopy does not visualize beyond the rectosigmoid colon. Patients with left-sided adenomas or adenocarcinomas have increased risk for synchronous neoplasia in the right colon and therefore require visualization of the entire colon with colonoscopy (Choice D). In addition, the staging evaluation should include CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to identify distant metastasis.Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels are also helpful for prognostication, although they exhibit low sensitivity and speciﬁcity for metastasis.

(Choice A) Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by mutations in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene and confers a very high risk of colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, affected individuals typically have numerous colon adenomas, not a solitary mass. Also, a more extensive family history would be expected because FAP is autosomal dominant with nearly 100% penetrance.

• A. Adenomatous Polyposis Coli gene testing (1%)

B. Colonoscopy of the entire colon (79%)

(Choice C) Patients with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) are at increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma and warrant periodic upper endoscopy to detect early adenomatous polyps. However, patients typically have an extensive family history of colon, endometrial, ovarian, and stomach cancers across multiple generations.

C. Endoscopy for gastric polyps (0%)

D. No additional testing (4%)

• E. Sentinel inguinal lymph node biopsy (14%)

(Choice E) Lymphatic drainage from areas distal to the anal dentate line involves inguinal lymph nodes. To rule out lymphatic metastasis in anal cancer, a sentinel inguinal lymph node biopsy is often obtained at the time of tumor resection. This is unnecessary for rectal tumors proximal to the anal dentate line because lymphatic drainage from this region goes to the inferior mesenteric and internal iliac, but not the inguinal, lymph nodes.

Sigmoidoscopy is an effective tool for evaluating lesions in the distal colon but does not visualize the right colon. Patients with left-sided adenomas or adenocarcinomas detected on sigmoidoscopy have increased risk for synchronous neoplasia on the right side and require visualization of the entire colon with colonoscopy.

A 50-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to a few weeks of fatigue and back pain. The patient has a history of hypertension and major depressive disorder. He does not use alcohol or intravenous drugs. The patient emigrated from Vietnam with his family when he was a child. BMI is 21 kg/m?. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals temporal wasting. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal, and no abdominal masses or tenderness is present. Spine palpation reveals signiﬁcant pain over a midlumbar spinous process. There are no palpable testicular lesions, and digital rectal examination reveals a smooth, normal-sized prostate. Laboratory results are as follows:

Explanation

This patient's back pain, cachexia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and multiple osteoblastic/osteolytic vertebral lesions likely indicate metastatic cancer of the spine. Although a wide range of cancers metastasize to the spine, the presence of elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a glycoprotein produced by the fetal liver and yolk sac, raises strong suspicion for primary testicular (yolk sac) or liver (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]) cancer. This patient's normal testicular examination, older age, and emigration from Vietnam make HCC most likely.

HCC usually arises in the setting of chronic liver inﬂammation due to heavy alcohol use, environmental toxins (eg, aﬂatoxin, betel nut chewing), or viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV]). Incidence is greatest in Asia (eg, Vietnam), Africa, and the Middle East due to high rates of underlying HBV/HCV infection. In these regions, viral transmission often occurs via the maternal-to-child route, leading to lifelong viral hepatitis in the newborn (and increased risk of cirrhosis/HCC later in life).

Liver function studies

Patients with HCC often develop systemic (eg, weight loss, fatigue), abdominal (eg, right upper quadrant pain, early satiety), or metastatic (eg, bone pain) manifestations. Liver function tests may be normal or elevated; alkaline phosphatase is occasionally dramatically elevated due to osteoblastic bone metastases (as in this case). Signiﬁcant elevation in alpha-fetoprotein raises strong suspicion for HCC but is present only in ~50% of cases.

(Choices C and E) Although multiple myeloma and renal cell cancer often spread to the spine, they usually cause purely osteolytic (not mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic) lesions. Therefore, alkaline phosphatase is usually normal (serum concentrations of this enzyme elevate in the setting of osteogenesis, not osteolysis). AFP elevations are rare.

A 45-year-old man comes to the clinic for suture removal. Two weeks ago, he was brought to the emergency department due to alcohol intoxication and was found to have a left leg laceration. The laceration was cleaned and sutured, and he received a tetanus toxoid vaccine and a prescription for oral antibiotics, which he completed. The patient has a history of alcohol use disorder and had been hospitalized on several occasions due to alcohol intoxication and acute alcoholic pancreatitis. The patient currently takes no medications, does not use tobacco, and smokes marijuana occasionally. He is experiencing homelessness and has had difﬁculty staying in homeless shelters regularly due to alcohol use. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), pulse is 82/min, blood pressure is 124/76 mm Hg, and respirations are 14/min. BMI is 18.8 kg/m?. Physical examination shows a disheveled man who appears older than his stated age. Dentition is poor with multiple dental caries. The gingiva is receded and bleeds easily to touch. Cardiopulmonary auscultation reveals clear lungs and normal heart sounds. The abdomen is soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly. Left lower extremity examination shows scant serosanguineous discharge on the wound dressing.The surgical sutures are intact, but the wound margins are poorly approximated. There is mild erythema at the wound borders with no tenderness or warmth. Mild, bilateral, lower-extremity pitting edema is present, and distal pulses are 2+. Skin examination shows scattered ecchymoses. Laboratory results are as follows:

• Musculoskeletal (eg, periosteal hemorrhage): arthralgia, limp

• Constitutional: malaise, depression, vasomotor instability

• Anemia (normocytic or microcytic)

• Normal platelet count & coagulation studies

• Oral/injectable vitamin C (improvement within days to weeks)

• Toxicity (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea) with excessive supplementation

This patient's history of alcohol use disorder, gingival bleeding, gingival recession, and

ecchymosis suggest his poorly healing wound is due to scurvy (vitamin C deficiency). Vitamin

C is an essential dietary nutrient found in citrus fruits and vegetables that acts as a reversible reducing agent and plays a crucial role in fatty acid transport and collagen synthesis. Most cases of vitamin C deﬁciency arise in the setting of severe malnutrition, which is frequently due to alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, or psychiatric illness.

Manifestations of scurvy usually occur within 3 months of a diet deﬁcient in vitamin C. Common ﬁndings include:

• A. Alcohol-induced bone marrow suppression (2%)

• Cutaneous manifestations - follicular hyperkeratosis, perifollicular hemorrhage,

• B. Chronic liver disease (16%).

Given the patient's concomitant fractures of the right lower ribs, which signal likely trauma of the right upper quadrant (RUQ), this presentation is most consistent with liver laceration.

The patient remains hypotensive after the rapid infusion of 2 L of intravenous crystalloid and is taken for emergency exploratory laparotomy. Which of the following injuries is the most likely cause of this patient's persistent hypotension?

The liver is one of the most frequently injured organs in BAT, with the spectrum of injury ranging from subcapsular hematoma to parenchymal disruption (ie, laceration) causing bleeding into the peritoneum. Trauma to the RUQ, right lower rib cage (eg, right eighth and ninth ribs), or right ﬂank should raise suspicion for hepatic injury.

Triage of patients with BAT without frank peritonitis (eg, abdominal rigidity, rebound tenderness) includes bedside Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) to assess for intraperitoneal free ﬂuid, a marker of intraabdominal organ injury. As in this case, hemodynamically unstable (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) patients with a positive FAST should undergo exploratory laparotomy.

(Choice A) Abdominal aortic injuries due to BAT are rare (<1%). Many patients with traumatic aortic injury die from exsanguination before reaching the hospital. Those who survive (because bleeding has been contained within the retroperitoneum) typically would not have a large amount of intraperitoneal free ﬂuid on FAST.

A. Abdominal aortic injury (10%)

B. Duodenal hematoma (1%)

C. Liver laceration (70%)

D. Pancreatic transection (0%)

(Choices B and E) BAT can cause duodenal and splenic hematoma from intraluminal and subcapsular bleeding, respectively. However, because the bleeding is contained within the lumen or capsule, hematoma formation often tamponades further bleeding, making such a severe degree of shock (eg, unresponsive to 2 L of volume resuscitation) less common. In addition, neither type of hematoma would cause intraperitoneal free ﬂuid.

• E. Splenic hematoma (15%).

• F. Urinary bladder rupture (0%)

(Choice D) Pancreatic injuries can occur with BAT, especially when the pancreas is crushed against the vertebral column by an anterior blow to the central abdomen. However, because of its retroperitoneal location, even severe injuries to the pancreas (eg, transection with pancreatic ﬂuid leakage) typically do not cause intraperitoneal free ﬂuid.

A 47-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce due to knee pain. The patient slipped on an icy step 2 weeks ago and fell on her knee. Since that time, she has had severe knee pain and a large overlying bruise, which has failed to heal. The patient underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 6 months ago for morbid obesity and has lost 20 kg (44.1 lb) since then.

She does not use tobacco or alcohol. Vital signs are normal. On examination, a large ecchymosis is present over the left knee. The knee is swollen, painful to palpation, and has a limited range of motion. There are several smaller ecchymoses and petechiae located on all four extremities. Laboratory results are as follows:

Vitamin C deﬁciency generally manifests ~3 months after insufﬁcient intake with follicular hyperkeratosis, perifollicular hemorrhage, coiled hairs, arthralgia, ecchymosis, petechiae, and/or gingivitis. Because vitamin C facilitates collagen synthesis, deﬁciency can lead to impaired wound healing and exacerbate bleeding. Laboratory studies often reveal mild anemia (possibly due to blood vessel fragility and bleeding), but platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) will be normal; signs of impaired macronutrient intake (eg, low albumin) can also sometimes occur. The diagnosis is generally made clinically, and treatment with vitamin C supplementation (ascorbic acid) is curative.

Prothrombin time 12 sec International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.1 (normal: 0.8-1.2) Activated partial thromboplastin time 31 sec

Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y surgery are at greatest risk for fat-soluble vitamin and vitamin B12 deﬁciency (due to reduced exposure of food to gastric acid and pancreatic enzymes), but vitamin C deﬁciency can sometimes occur due to poor adherence to postoperative dietary recommendations.

Left knee x-ray reveals a large effusion but no fracture. Arthrocentesis yields brown ﬂuid positive for xanthochromia. Which of the following best explains this patient's manifestations?

(Choice A) Factor VIII inhibitors are autoantibodies against factor VIII that usually develop in the setting of pregnancy, malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients generally have easy bleeding, hematomas, and prolonged PTT. This patient's normal PTT makes a factor VIII inhibitor unlikely.

• A. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor (11%)

B. Acquired platelet dysfunction (36%)

C. Small vessel vasculitis (3%)

D. Vitamin C deﬁciency (49%)

(Choice B) Acquired platelet dysfunction is usually seen in the setting of aspirin use, uremia, advanced liver disease, or cardiopulmonary bypass. Although this can cause ecchymosis and easy bleeding, Roux-en-Y bypass is not associated with acquired platelet dysfunction; vitamin deﬁciency is far more likely.

(Choice C) Small vessel vasculitis (eg, microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis) usually causes palpable purpura and nonblanching petechiae; large ecchymoses and hemarthroses are less common.

Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are at risk for multiple vitamin deﬁciencies. Fat-soluble vitamins and vitamin B12 deﬁciency are most common, but vitamin C deﬁciency can occur in the setting of poor postoperative diet. Vitamin C deﬁciency is associated with ecchymosis, petechiae, poor wound healing, perifollicular hemorrhage, coiled hairs, and gingivitis; platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time will be normal.

occurs as a complication of hepatic or biliopancreatic interventions (eg, liver biopsy, cholecystectomy, endoscopic cholangiopancreatography); other etiologies include hepatobiliary tumors and blunt trauma. Massive hemobilia results in hemodynamic instability and UGIB that occurs immediately after the procedure; intraductal hematoma formation more commonly results in delayed UGIB until after dissolution of the clot (usually ~5 days post-procedure). Patients typically present with RUQ pain, jaundice, and UGIB (eg, melena, hematemesis). Laboratory ﬁndings include direct hyperbilirubinemia from bile duct obstruction and anemia; leukocytosis (and reactive thrombocytosis) can occur due to inﬂammation. Abdominal imaging (eg, CT scan, ultrasound) can identify hematomas and intraabdominal free ﬂuid, and endoscopic evaluation may reveal oozing of blood from the papilla. Hemobilia is usually self-limited and often managed conservatively (eg, intravenous ﬂuids, blood transfusions); however, angiography with embolization or surgery may be required for persistent bleeding.

However, cholecystitis causes neither hyperbilirubinemia nor jaundice (which typically occur with acute cholangitis), nor would it cause melena or anemia. It is also often associated with fever. (Choice B) Gallstone pancreatitis also presents with fever, vomiting, hyperbilirubinemia, and leukocytosis. However, the pain is typically epigastric and radiates to the back; melena and anemia are unexpected.

(Choice C) Aortoenteric ﬁstula causes massive gastrointestinal bleeding and usually results from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm or after aortic surgery; it is not a typical complication of liver biopsy. In addition, hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice are unexpected. (Choice E) Liver abscesses can form after liver biopsy and present with RUQ pain, leukocytosis, and possibly hyperbilirubinemia when they compress the biliary tree; however, fevers are typical, and UGIB would not occur.

• E. Liver abscess (7%)

• F. Perforated duodenal ulcer (9%).

(Choice F) A perforated duodenal ulcer can cause abdominal pain and melena, but the pain is usually generalized and severe (rather than focal RUQ pain) and associated with fever, abdominal distension, rebound, and guarding. Jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia are unexpected.

A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a friend after vomiting bright

red blood several times during the past 2 hours. The patient has no abdominal pain or diarrhea. He has a history of peptic ulcer disease and alcoholic cirrhosis. His friend says that the patient continues to drink alcohol and is not sure whether he is taking his medications regularly. Temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 96/62 mm Hg, and pulse is 112/min. The patient has muscle wasting and scleral icterus. The abdomen is nontender and distended with bulging ﬂanks. Rectal examination shows internal hemorrhoids and maroon stool that is positive for occult blood. He is receiving a normal saline infusion through a peripheral intravenous catheter. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

This patient has hematemesis in the setting of a history of peptic ulcer disease and alcoholic cirrhosis, which places him at risk for rapid, life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Therefore, prompt and aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation should be the ﬁrst step in management. All patients with acute hemorrhage should have vascular access established immediately with at least 2 large-bore intravenous lines.

• A. Administer octreotide infusion (27%)

B. Obtain second intravenous access (43%)

C. Perform esophagogastroduodenoscopy (24%)

Once appropriate vascular access has been established, ﬂuid resuscitation with crystalloid should be undertaken while any necessary blood products are prepared for transfusion (eg, packed red blood cell transfusion to maintain hemoglobin at least ≥7 g/dL). In addition, patients' airway, vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and urine output should be closely monitored. Patients with UGIB should also receive acid suppression with intravenous proton pump inhibitors and have all oral intake restricted. If variceal bleeding is suspected, as in this case, an octreotide infusion should be considered (Choice A). Patients with cirrhosis should also receive prophylactic antibiotics.

Once patients are stabilized, upper endoscopy should be performed to identify and control the source of hemorrhage and to prevent recurrent episodes (Choice C). In approximately 50% of cases of variceal bleeding, the hemorrhage ceases on its own without further intervention; this rate is signiﬁcantly lower than that seen in UGIB due to other causes, which approaches 90%. (Choice D) Contrast angiography should be considered in the small number of patients with UGIB who are not able to be stabilized sufﬁciently to undergo upper endoscopy or in whom upper endoscopy is unsuccessful in controlling hemorrhage.

Answered correctly

(Choice E) Balloon tamponade with the Sengstaken-Blakemore, Minnesota, or Linton-Nachlas tubes can be used for the temporary control of bleeding when early endoscopy is unavailable or other modalities are unavailable and medical management is unsuccessful. This method is most often used to control hemorrhage until the patient can be transferred to a tertiary care hospital; it is not considered ﬁrst-line treatment.

Educational objective:

The ﬁrst step in the treatment of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is to establish vascular access with 2 large-bore intravenous catheters to initiate resuscitation with intravenous ﬂuids.

This patient with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea following a vascular procedure has typical features of ischemic colitis. The pain of ischemic colitis is usually moderate and lateralizes to the affected side. Repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a common precipitating event as patients are often older and have extensive atherosclerotic vascular disease. Contributing factors may include loss of collateral circulation, manipulation of vessels with surgical instruments, prolonged aortic clamping, and impaired blood ﬂow through the inferior mesenteric artery.

CT imaging in ischemic colitis can show edema (eg, thickening) and air (pneumatosis) in the bowel wall. Colonoscopy shows segments of cyanotic mucosa and hemorrhagic ulcerations, with a sharp transition from affected to unaffected mucosa. Unless the patient has perforation or bowel gangrene, most cases are managed conservatively with intravenous ﬂuids, bowel rest, and antibiotics.

(Choice A) Acute diverticulitis would cause left lower quadrant pain, and diverticula may cause rectal bleeding. However, diverticulitis and diverticular hemorrhage are independent events,

(Choice D) Chronic radiation proctopathy often causes bloody stools, but usually presents for the ﬁrst time within the ﬁrst year. Colonoscopy would show pale mucosa with ulcers, strictures, telangiectasias, and focal hemorrhage.

(Choice E) Ulcerative colitis can cause abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea; however, it would be unlikely to present for the ﬁrst time at age 75. In addition, ischemic colitis usually spares the rectum (due to collateral circulation) whereas ulcerative colitis would not.

version

This patient's abdominal angiography is consistent with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a systemic vasculitis of medium-sized muscular arteries. PAN causes segmental, transmural inﬂammation in the arterial wall and damages the internal and external elastic laminae, which results in arterial lumen narrowing and microaneurysms. Because luminal narrowing decreases distal blood ﬂow and increases the risk of acute thrombosis, patients with PAN often present with symptoms of tissue ischemia or infarction. Arterial damage is usually most prominent in the kidneys, neurologic system, skin, and gastrointestinal tract.

Damage to the mesenteric vessels often causes mesenteric ischemia, which is marked by intermittent abdominal pain after eating, decreased food consumption, and weight loss; bowel wall necrosis may cause perforation.

A 11-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department due to persistent vomiting. The

Explanation

ﬁrst episode of emesis occurred 12 hours ago, and for the past 4 hours, the patient has been unable to keep any liquids down. She also has nausea and epigastric discomfort but no fever, abdominal distension, or diarrhea. The patient is a competitive gymnast. Yesterday, she tell ana struck ner abdomen nara on the balance beam during practice. lemperature Is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 106/72 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, mucous membranes are dry. Lung and heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is scaphoid with linear bruising across the epigastrium. On palpation, there is epigastric tenderness without guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. Upright chest and abdominal x-rays are normal, with no free air under the diaphragm. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma reveals no intraperitoneal free ﬂuid or air. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

This patient has epigastric discomfort, nausea, and worsening emesis approximately 1 day after blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) (eg, balance beam impact). This presentation is concerning for duodenal hematoma (DH) and is best evaluated with abdominal CT scan. Rapid compression of the duodenum against the vertebral column during BAT can injure blood vessels between the submucosal and the muscularis layers, causing bleeding and hematoma formation. Continued hematoma expansion over the subsequent 24-48 hours can lead to progressive obstruction of the duodenal lumen, as in this patient with worsening emesis who can no longer tolerate liquids (eg, complete obstruction).

A. Antiemetics and observation only (15%)

B. CT scan of the abdomen (77%)

C. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (3%)

D. Exploratory laparotomy (3%)

CT scan of the abdomen can conﬁrm the diagnosis and visualize the extent of the hematoma, which typically appears as a homogenous density (ie, coagulated blood) within the C-shaped duodenum. Once conﬁrmed, DHs typically are managed with bowel rest, nasogastric decompression, and parenteral nutrition and are followed with serial CT scans or duodenal ultrasonography. Most DHs resolve within a few weeks with nonoperative management.

(Choice C) The role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage has been largely reduced to evaluating for intraabdominal hemorrhage in hemodynamically unstable patients with questionable bedside ultrasound results. This patient is hemodynamically stable and can undergo deﬁnitive imaging with CT scan.

Version

(Choice D) Exploratory laparotomy is indicated when patients with BAT have peritonitis (eg, rigidity, rebound tenderness) or hemodynamic instability (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) with evidence of intraabdominal hemorrhage (eg, intraperitoneal free ﬂuid). This patient

has none of these indications.

(Choice E) Gallbladder ultrasonography is commonly used to evaluate for suspected cholecystitis, which can cause epigastric discomfort and emesis but typically also causes fever and right upper quadrant tenderness. Isolated gallbladder injury from BAT is extremely rare, given the gallbladder's protected location under the liver's edge.

This patient's clinical presentation is concerning for acute diverticulitis, which is characterized by focal inﬂammation in the colon wall due to microperforation of a diverticulum. Typical features of diverticulitis include left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, nausea/vomiting, and leukocytosis; altered bowel movements (eg, loose stools in this patient with constipation) and a palpable, tender mass (from focal inﬂammation) may be present. Patients may also have dysuria or urinary urgency or frequency due to bladder irritation from an adjacent inﬂamed sigmoid colon. Risk factors include chronic constipation and a low-ﬁber, high-fat diet.

2023

version

CT scan of the abdomen with oral and intravenous contrast is the best diagnostic test for diverticulitis and has very high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Findings that suggest diverticulitis include focal bowel wall thickening and inﬂammatory signs (eg, stranding) in pericolonic fat. Visible diverticula are often not present and are not necessary for making the diagnosis. CT scan may also reveal evidence of complications, such as phlegmon (inﬂammatory tissue mass) or abscess (eg, pericolic ﬂuid collection).

(Choice B) Colonoscopy is indicated 6-8 weeks after resolution of symptoms to rule out colon adenocarcinoma (which can be a risk factor for acute diverticulitis). Sigmoidoscopy with barium contrast enema is a reasonable option for patients unable to undergo colonoscopy.

(Choice B) Colonoscopy is indicated 6-8 weeks after resolution of symptoms to rule out colon adenocarcinoma (which can be a risk factor for acute diverticulitis). Sigmoidoscopy with barium contrast enema is a reasonable option for patients unable to undergo colonoscopy. However, neither of these procedures should be performed in the acute phase because each increases the risk of colon perforation. In contrast, colonoscopy is useful in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding due to diverticulosis.

C. Pelvic ultrasonography (9%)

(Choice C) Pelvic ultrasonography is useful for evaluating conditions of the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa. Such disorders are unlikely in this patient with a prior hysterectomy and are less commonly associated with bowel movement alteration. Ultrasonography has much lower sensitivity and speciﬁcity than CT for diverticulitis.

A 12-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department due to severe pain in the right upper quadrant, which started suddenly 12 hours ago. The patient has also had nausea, vomiting, fever, and rigors. Medical and family histories are both unremarkable. Temperature is 39.3 C (102.7 F), blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 18/min. Scleral icterus is present. The abdomen is tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant without rebound or involuntary guarding. Laboratory results are as

Liver studies Total bilirubin 8.1 mg/dL Direct bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase 650 U/L Aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 82 U/L Alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 62 U/L

Although biliary cysts classically cause chronic or subacute jaundice, RUQ pain, and a RUQ mass, some patients (like this one) initially present with complications. Proximal narrowing of the cystic lesion can cause mild obstruction, allowing for translocation of bacteria from the portal circulation, as well as stasis within the bile ducts, promoting the development of acute cholangitis. Classic ﬁndings of obstructive cholestasis include direct hyperbilirubinemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase; the addition of severe pain, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis is indicative of acute cholangitis. Transaminases may be mildly elevated.

Regardless of the underlying etiology, acute cholangitis is treated with intravenous ﬂuid, antibiotics, and urgent biliary drainage. Drainage is best achieved using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with a sphincterotomy and/or a biliary stent is used to facilitate the ﬂow of bile. Once the patient has recovered from acute cholangitis, complete surgical excision of the biliary cyst should be performed to reduce the risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.

(Choice A) After biliary drainage with ERCP, acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis, a diagnosis more common in adults, warrants cholecystectomy to prevent recurrent episodes. This patient has no stones; therefore, cholecystectomy would not prevent the recurrence of acute cholangitis in this patient.

14.0 g/dL 345,000/mm3

(Choices B and D) Cystoenterostomy (ie, connecting the biliary cyst to the small bowel) and percutaneous drainage both facilitate biliary ﬂow in patients with cholestasis.However, both are more invasive than ERCP and therefore are not ﬁrst-line management. Moreover, cystoenterostomy does not prevent the risk of cholangiocarcinoma associated with biliary cysts and would not be performed in lieu of complete cyst excision.

21,000/mm3 Abdominal imaging reveals mild gallbladder distension without stones or mucosal thickening; a cyst is present in the common bile duct with dilation of the intrahepatic ducts. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

Educational objective:

• A. Cholecystectomy (10%)

• B. Cystoenterostomy (19%)

The initial presentation of a biliary cyst may be acute cholangitis and should be suspected in a patient with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and obstructive jaundice, as well as a cystic bile duct mass. Initial management of acute cholangitis is urgent biliary drainage (ie, endoscopic sphincterotomy); complete surgical excision of the cyst should be performed later to reduce the risk of cholangiocarcinoma.

C. Endoscopic sphincterotomy and drainage (36%)

D. Percutaneous drainage of the cyst (33%)

A 40-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a week of progressive

Explanation

abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, and nausea. Over the last 2 days, he has also had several episodes of vomiting.Six weeks ago, he was hospitalized for an episode of acute pancreatitis. The patient used to drink heavily before the hospitalization but has been abstinent since then. He also has a history of emergency department visits due to alcohol intoxication and street ﬁghts. The patient does not use tobacco or illicit drugs. His temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 117/84 mm Hg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 16/min. Examination shows epigastric fullness and tenderness. Bowel sounds are present. There is no rebound tenderness or rigidity. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. There is no peripheral edema. Complete blood count and serum chemistries are within normal limits. CT scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast is shown below. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

This patient with a history of alcohol use and a recent episode of pancreatitis now has progressive abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting, with a CT scan showing a round, well-circumscribed, encapsulated ﬂuid collection in the pancreatic bed, consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst.Pseudocysts are mature walled-off pancreatic ﬂuid collections (usually no necrosis or solid material) surrounded by a thick ﬁbrous capsule and containing enzyme-rich ﬂuid, tissue, and debris. They can leak amylase-rich ﬂuid into the circulation and increase serum amylase. Complications include spontaneous infection, duodenal or biliary obstruction, pseudoaneurysm (due to digestion of adjacent vessels), pancreatic ascites, and pleural effusion. Abdominal imaging usually conﬁrms the diagnosis.

In patients with minimal or no symptoms and without complications (eg, pseudoaneurysm), expectant management (eg, symptomatic therapy, nothing by mouth) is preferred initially. Endoscopic drainage is typically reserved for those (such as this patient) with signiﬁcant symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, vomiting), infected pseudocyst, or evidence of pseudoaneurysm (usually embolized before drainage procedure).

(Choice A) Cholecystectomy is performed (usually following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) in patients who have recovered from gallstone pancreatitis, which typically presents with elevated liver function studies, amylase, lipase, and (often) serum bilirubin. This patient's normal serum chemistries make gallstone pancreatitis unlikely.

(Choice C) Intravenous antibiotics are typically given for an infected pseudocyst. The absence of fever and leukocyte count elevation in this patient makes infection less likely. (Choice D) This patient has worsening distension, nausea, and vomiting, likely due to pseudocyst compression of surrounding structures; he would beneﬁt from endoscopic drainage.

(Choice E) Pancreatic enzyme supplementation is usually given to patients with chronic pancreatitis and exocrine pancreatic insufﬁciency (eg, steatorrhea due to fat malabsorption). Although this patient has chronic alcohol use and a recent episode of acute pancreatitis, the absence of diarrhea makes pancreatic insufﬁciency less likely.

Pancreatic pseudocyst is an encapsulated area (comprised of enzyme-rich ﬂuid, tissue, and debris) that causes an inﬂammatory response. Diagnosis is conﬁrmed by abdominal imaging. Expectant management is preferred initially in patients with minimal or no symptoms and without complications. Endoscopic drainage is typically reserved for patients with signiﬁcant symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, vomiting), infected pseudocyst, or evidence of pseudoaneurysm.

A 45-year-old woman is evaluated on postoperative day 3 due to nausea and vomiting. The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy for symptomatic uterine ﬁbroids, and the surgery was complicated by ureter injury and stent placement.She was placed on a clear liquid diet on postoperative day 2, when she began to have some nausea. Since then, the patient has had multiple episodes of vomiting but no hematemesis. She has not passed ﬂatus or had a bowel movement since the surgery. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 80/min. The abdomen is mildly distended and has decreased bowel sounds. The incision is tender to palpation but has no surrounding erythema or discharge. Laboratory results are as follows:

Abdominal x-ray is shown in the exhibit. In addition to intravenous ﬂuid administration, which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?

Postoperative ileus typically self-resolves as bowel motility gradually returns; therefore, patients

are conservatively managed with antiemetics, bowel rest, and serial examinations.

Opiates, which further decrease bowel motility, should be avoided if possible.

(Choice B) Broad-spectrum antibiotics are used to treat abdominal infections (eg, acute

diverticulitis), not postoperative ileus. This patient is afebrile, has a normal incision, and does not have leukocytosis, making infection unlikely.

(Choice C) A rectal enema can treat constipation by increasing pressure against impacted

stool. It does not treat ileus and may worsen symptoms (ie, cause more bowel distension) by increasing intraluminal pressure.

(Choice D) Small bowel follow-through can be used to diagnose SBO by demonstrating differences in the ﬂow of contrast proximal and distal to an obstruction. It has limited utility in patients with postoperative ileus because bowel dysmotility is generalized.

• A. Bowel rest and serial examinations (60%)

• B. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (2%)

(Choice E) Urgent surgical exploration is indicated in patients with an acute abdomen (eg, perforated bowel). It is not indicated for postoperative ileus unless there are changes between serial examinations (eg, new rebound/guarding).

C. Rectal enema (11%)

Educational objective:

• D. Small bowel follow-through (7%)

E. Urgent surgical exploration (17%)

Prolonged postoperative ileus, the delayed return of bowel function >72 hours after surgery, is typically self-resolving; therefore, management is conservative with bowel rest and serial examinations.

A 68-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce due to a groin bulge.She ﬁrst noticed it 2 months ago and says that it gets larger with prolonged standing and shrinks with lying down, but it is not painful. There has been no trauma to the area. The patient has had no fever, nausea, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. She has a history of obstructive pulmonary disease with occasional exacerbations and hypertension.The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years.Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 16/min. BMI is 34 kg/m?. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination shows mildly decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and nontender; bowel sounds are normal. There is a 2-cm groin mass below the right inguinal ligament, which is medial to the right femoral artery; no tenderness, pulsations, or overlying erythema is present.

A 68-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce due to a groin bulge.She ﬁrst noticed it 2 months ago and says that it gets larger with prolonged standing and shrinks with lying down, but it is not painful. There has been no trauma to the area. The patient has had no fever, nausea, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. She has a history of obstructive pulmonary disease with occasional exacerbations and hypertension. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 16/min. BMI is 34 kg/m?. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination shows mildly decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and nontender; bowel sounds are normal. There is a 2-cm groin mass below the right inguinal ligament, which is medial to the right femoral artery; no tenderness, pulsations, or overlying erythema is present. The mass is tympanitic to percussion. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Because femoral hernias pass through a narrow orifice, they are associated with a substantial

risk of incarceration (trapping of abdominal/pelvic contents within the hernia) and strangulation (constriction of blood ﬂow with subsequent ischemia/necrosis). Therefore, asymptomatic femoral hernias are generally referred for elective surgical repair to prevent potentially life-threatening complications and subsequent high-risk emergency surgery, which is associated with an increased risk of morbidity (eg, bowel resection) and mortality.

In contrast, inguinal hernias (hernia above the inguinal ligament) are associated with a lower risk for incarceration and strangulation because hernia contents pass through a wider oriﬁce. Therefore, most asymptomatic inguinal hernias can be managed with reassurance and watchful waiting. Observation can also be considered for patients with chronic (>3 months), stable femoral hernias, but is not recommended for most patients with femoral hernias due to the risk of incarceration (Choice E).

• E. Reassurance and observation (15%) .

(Choices C and D) Diverticulitis usually presents with lower abdominal pain and, occasionally, a tender lower abdominal mass. Treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis generally includes oral antibiotics; percutaneous drainage is sometimes required when diverticular abscess is present. Other infections that can develop in the groin include cutaneous abscesses or lymphangitis. This patient's mass is nontender and not associated with erythema or fever, making infection less likely.

Femoral hernias (hernia located below inguinal ligament) protrude through the femoral ring and usually present with a nontender, nonpulsatile bulge in the groin that grows in size with increased abdominal pressure. Because the risk of incarceration with femoral hernias is high (due to narrow hernia oriﬁce), patients with asymptomatic femoral hernias are referred for early elective hernia repair. In contrast, asymptomatic inguinal hernias (hernia located above inguinal ligament) can usually be managed with watchful waiting because hernia contents pass through a wider oriﬁce.

PA frequently presents subacutely with fever and lower abdominal or ﬂank pain, although symptoms (eg, anorexia, weight loss) can be nonspeciﬁc. Consequently, PA should be considered as part of the evaluation for fever of unknown origin. Deep abdominal palpation is required to elicit tenderness due to the location of the psoas on the posterior abdominal wall. The "psoas sign," abdominal pain with hip extension, can often be detected on examination. Laboratory studies commonly show leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and elevated inﬂammatory markers. CT scans are required to conﬁrm the diagnosis. Drainage is critical, and blood and abscess cultures should be obtained to guide antibiotic therapy.

Abdominal ultrasound of the right upper quadrant shows a solid liver mass and free ﬂuid in the abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Explanation

Hepatic adenoma

• Benign epithelial liver tumor

Epidemiology

• Primarily young women on oral contraception

• Often asymptomatic (incidentally found)

Manifestations

• Episodic right upper quadrant pain

• Solitary, solid lesion in right lobe of liver

Imaging

• Multiple lesions occasionally occur

• Asymptomatic & <5 cm - stop oral contraception

Treatment

• Symptomatic or >5 cm - surgical resection

• Malignant transformation (~10%)

Complications

• Rupture & hemorrhagic shock

• B. A. Hepatic Focal nodular hyperplasia (1%) abscess (9%)

C. Hepatic adenoma (50%)

D. Hepatic hemangioma (17%)

• E. Hepatocellular carcinoma (0%)

• F. Hydatid cyst (19%),

This patient's hypotension, tachycardia, syncope, poor capillary reﬁll, cold extremities, and anemia indicate likely hemorrhagic shock.Given her sudden-onset, severe right upper quadrant pain, solid liver mass, and free abdominal ﬂuid, the most likely underlying cause is a ruptured hepatic adenoma.

Omitted

Hepatic adenomas generally arise in young women who have been on prolonged estrogenbased oral contraception. Although considered benign and often discovered incidentally on imaging for other conditions, hepatic adenoma can cause life-threatening complications such as malignant transformation and rupture. Rupture should be suspected in those with suddenonset, severe right upper quadrant pain who have signs of hemorrhagic shock; low-grade fever and mild leukocytosis also sometimes occur due to peritoneal irritation from blood in the abdominal cavity. Ultrasound generally reveals a single, solid liver lesion (usually in the right hepatic lobe) and free ﬂuid (blood) in the abdomen. Urgent circulatory support and surgical intervention are required to prevent death.

(Choice A) Focal nodular hyperplasia is a benign liver lesion seen most often in young women.It is not linked to oral contraception use and is usually asymptomatic; complications such as rupture or malignant transformation do not generally occur.

(Choice B) Hepatic abscess is most common in the setting of bowel perforation or biliary infection. Although patients often have fever and progressive right upper quadrant pain, the presence of sudden right upper quadrant pain and hemorrhagic shock (eg, syncope, poor perfusion/capillary reﬁll) would be atypical. In addition, ultrasound usually shows a lesion with internal debris or septation (not a solid mass).

(Choice D) Hepatic hemangioma is the most common benign liver lesion. It is generally asymptomatic, but larger lesions can sometimes cause right upper quadrant pain. Spontaneous rupture of this vascular lesion is very rare; therefore, a solid liver lesion with surrounding free ﬂuid is unlikely.

(Choice E) Hepatocellular carcinoma usually occurs in older individuals with long-standing alcohol abuse or chronic viral hepatitis. Most cases present with progressive, subacute right upper quadrant abdominal pain or decompensated cirrhosis.

Educational objective:

Young women on prolonged oral contraception are at greatest risk for hepatic adenoma. Although most lesions are benign and asymptomatic, life-threatening complications such as malignant transformation or rupture can occur.

This patient has symptoms of gas-bloat syndrome (eg, bloating, inability to belch) after Nissen fundoplication, a surgical procedure used to treat resistant gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. During this procedure, the fundus is folded and sewn around the lower esophageal

sphincter (LES) to decrease the amount of gastric acid that refluxes into the esophagus.

Gas-bloat syndrome is thought to be the result of gastric air trapping due to the tightened LES.

Symptoms typically develop postprandially and are often precipitated by the consumption of carbonated beverages. Patients can generally be reassured that the condition is benign and

usually improves over time with simethicone and avoidance of carbonated beverages.

Persistent cases may require pyloroplasty or conversion from a full to a partial fundoplication

The abdomen is nontender and nondistended. In addition to avoidance of carbonated beverages, which of the following would be the best next step in management?

This patient has symptoms of gas-bloat syndrome (eg, bloating, inability to belch) after Nissen fundoplication, a surgical procedure used to treat resistant gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. During this procedure, the fundus is folded and sewn around the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to decrease the amount of gastric acid that reﬂuxes into the esophagus. Gas-bloat syndrome is thought to be the result of gastric air trapping due to the tightened LES. Symptoms typically develop postprandially and are often precipitated by the consumption of carbonated beverages. Patients can generally be reassured that the condition is benign and usually improves over time with simethicone and avoidance of carbonated beverages. Persistent cases may require pyloroplasty or conversion from a full to a partial fundoplication

D. Treatment with simethicone

E. Upper endoscopy with esophageal dilation

(Choices A and E) Dysphagia is common within 12 weeks of Nissen fundoplication and usually self-resolves. For patients with long-standing dysphagia after surgery (ie, > 12 weeks), barium esophagography (ie, barium swallow) can identify narrowing of the distal esophagus. These patients beneﬁt from esophageal dilation, a procedure usually performed during upper endoscopy. Because this patient does not have dysphagia, neither procedure is indicated.

A 60-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce because of an enlarging left inguinal bulge. The patient has intermittently noticed the bulge over the past 2 years. It has become slightly larger over the past few months while he has been caring for his terminally ill wife and performing her transfers. He has had no associated pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in his bowel habits. Medical history is signiﬁcant for hypertension and obesity. Height is 177.5 cm (5 ft 10 in), weight is 98 kg (216 lb), and BMI is 31 kg/m?. Vital signs are normal. On examination, the abdomen is soft and nontender, with normal bowel sounds. When the patient stands, there is a nontender bulge in the left groin directly above the inguinal ligament; it increases in size with Valsalva maneuver and fully reduces when the patient is in the supine position. The patient is interested in surgical repair but would like to postpone surgery for a few months. Which of the following is the most accurate response?

Explanation

This patient has an enlarging inguinal bulge that increases in size with Valsalva maneuver and reduces when the patient is supine, which is consistent with a groin hernia.Based on its location above the inguinal ligament, it is most likely an indirect or direct inguinal hernia (vs a femoral hernia). Although the hernia has grown larger over the past few months, the patient has experienced no associated pain, symptoms of incarceration (eg, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits), or inability to perform daily activities due to the hernia. Therefore, the hernia is considered asymptomatic.

surgery."

"Postponing surgical repair is reasonable because the hernia is

asymptomatic."

"Surgery is indicated only if the hernia causes nausea, vomiting, or

abdominal pain."

"Surgical repair is not recommended because of your other medical

conditions."

For patients, such as this one, with asymptomatic inguinal hernias, watchful waiting can be safely offered as an alternative to surgical repair. The risk of incarceration during the period of watchful waiting is low (<1%), and quality of life outcomes are equivalent to those of surgical repair. Most patients with asymptomatic inguinal hernias will eventually develop symptoms (eg, pain, limitations on activity) and require repair (up to 70% by 10 years) (Choice B). Even so, delayed repair has similar outcomes and no higher risk of perioperative complications compared to surgical repair at the time of diagnosis (Choice A).

(77%)

(3%) (0%)

Postponing surgical repair is both safe and reasonable in this patient, especially given his current life circumstances (eg, caring for his terminally ill wife). As part of the discussion about watchful waiting, he should be counseled to seek medical attention if his hernia becomes symptomatic (eg, painful, activity-limiting) or incarcerated.

Omitted

(Choice D) The presence of nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain indicates that a hernia is symptomatic and possibly incarcerated. Surgical repair is indicated (potentially urgently) for symptomatic hernias, but it can also be offered electively to patients with asymptomatic hernias. It is a good option especially in young patients because most patients with asymptomatic hernias eventually develop symptoms (up to 70% by 10 years).

A 52-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce due to intermittent right upper quadrant pain and nausea. The patient has a history of obesity and gallstones, for which she underwent elective cholecystectomy a year ago. The pain is located in the right subcostal area and generally lasts 30-60 minutes. The patient recalls that she had similar episodes before the surgery. Laboratory results after one of the episodes are as follows:

Total bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL Direct bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase 185 U/L Aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 84 U/L Alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 72 U/L

Abdominal ultrasound examination reveals mild dilation of the common bile duct. The pancreas is visualized and appears normal. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

symptoms • Biliary causes

• Early: bile leak (eg, bile duct injury), retained CBD stone

Etiology

• Late: biliary stricture, recurrent CBD stone, SOD

• Extrabiliary causes: PUD, IBS, pancreatitis, coronary artery disease

• Persistent abdominal pain, dyspepsia

Common features

• | LFT levels & CBD dilation suggest biliary cause

CBD = common bile duct; IBS = irritable bowel syndrome; LFT = liver function test; PUD = peptic ulcer disease; SOD = sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.

• A. Antimitochondrial antibody test.

B. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography

C. Helicobacter pylori stool antigen testing

This patient's presentation is concerning for postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS), recurrent or persistent abdominal pain and/or dyspepsia (eg, nausea, indigestion) that occurs in either the immediate postoperative period (early) or months to years later (late). Symptoms are characteristically similar to those experienced before cholecystectomy.

• D. Liver biopsy

E. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy

PCS, which is deﬁned by its symptoms, may be caused by a number of conditions, both biliary and extrabiliary. Common biliary causes include retained or recurrent stone in the common bile duct (CBD) and bile leak (eg, intraoperative bile duct injury). Biliary stricture (eg, late sequala of intraoperative thermal injury) and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) can also cause PCS.

A biliary cause should be suspected when a patient has elevations in liver function test results (eg, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferases) and CBD dilation on ultrasonography. In particular, these ﬁndings suggest a CBD stone, biliary stricture, or SOD. Further evaluation of the biliary tree with MR cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can conﬁrm the diagnosis and guide therapy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause.

(Choice A) Antimitochondrial antibodies are usually detected in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). However, affected patients typically have other symptoms (eg, pruritus, fatigue, jaundice) along with abdominal pain. Although PBC can present with laboratory ﬁndings of cholestasis (eg, elevated bilirubin, elevated alkaline phosphatase), imaging typically does not show a dilated CBD.

(Choice C) Helicobacter pylori stool antigen testing is used to diagnose H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease. It is not typically associated with abnormal liver function or a dilated CBD.

(Choice D) Liver biopsy should be performed when there is evidence of liver injury (eg, elevated liver function test levels) and the initial evaluation (laboratory analysis and imaging) does not provide a deﬁnitive diagnosis. This patient may eventually require liver biopsy if ERCP and other studies are unremarkable, but it is not the best next step.

An 80-year-old woman is brought to the hospital with progressively increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and an inability to keep food down since yesterday. Her only medical condition is chronic paroxysmal atrial ﬁbrillation, for which she takes metoprolol and apixaban, and she has never had any surgeries. The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol.

Bowel sounds are increased and high-pitched. Rectal examination shows no stool in the rectal vault and no masses. Fullness and tenderness are noted in the right groin area. The extremities are without cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Laboratory testing yields a hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 38 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL.

with dry mucous membranes and elevated creatinine), abdominal distension, and high-pitched bowel sounds on examination. In association with the abdominal x-rays demonstrating distended loops of bowel with air-ﬂuid levels, this presentation suggests a small bowel obstruction (SBO). The presence of fullness and tenderness within the right groin suggest the SBO is due to an incarcerated hernia of the groin.

Groin hernias (ie, inguinal, femoral) result from protrusion of intraabdominal (eg, small bowel) or pelvic contents through the abdominal wall. Uncomplicated hernias typically present as a groin bulge that becomes more prominent with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, cough, Valsalva). Although inguinal hernias are much more common, femoral hernias occur more frequently in elderly women and are much more likely to lead to complications. Incarceration occurs when hernia contents become trapped within the hernia sac, which can result in SBO; reduced venous outﬂow eventually leads to ischemia and necrosis (strangulation).

• G. Watershed bowel hypoperfusion (7%)

(Choice A) Groin hematomas can cause extrinsic compression resulting in an SBO, and are more common in anticoagulated patients. However, patients typically have a history of trauma, and anemia and ecchymosis would be expected.

(Choices B and E) Small bowel adhesions and strictures typically occur as a complication of Crohn disease or intraabdominal surgery. These can cause SBO but are unlikely in this patient without a history of surgery or inﬂammatory bowel disease. In addition, these disorders are not associated with groin ﬁndings.

(Choice D) Small bowel intussusception can cause SBO but usually occurs in children and is very rare in adults. Hematochezia is common, and patients typically have a history of intermittent abdominal pain (due to recurrent telescoping of the bowel). Groin ﬁndings are unexpected.

This patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of acalculous cholecystitis, acute inﬂammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones. Acalculous cholecystitis is most often seen in patients who have experienced severe trauma, recent surgery (eg, pelvic ﬁxation), critical illness, and/or prolonged fasting or total parenteral nutrition. These conditions likely cause gallbladder stasis and ischemia, leading to distension, necrosis, and secondary bacterial infection. In addition, these conditions can cause adynamic ileus, as seen in this patient with diminished bowel sounds, retention of gastric contents (as evidenced on nasogastric tube aspiration), and gaseous small and large bowel distension on imaging.

The diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion because the clinical signs of disease (eg, right upper quadrant tenderness, fever, leukocytosis) may be subtle, and vulnerable patients are typically too ill to verbalize symptoms. Imaging (eg, ultrasonography, CT scan) that reveals gallbladder distension, wall thickening, and pericholecystic ﬂuid in the absence of gallstones supports the diagnosis. Immediate

On the ﬁfth day of hospitalization, he is minimally responsive and has spontaneous respirations. Examination shows diminished bowel sounds and facial grimacing with palpation of the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Rectal examination demonstrates no abnormalities. Nasogastric tube aspiration shows retention of gastric contents. Abdominal CT scan reveals gaseous distension of the small and large bowels without air-ﬂuid levels.

be subtle, and vulnerable patients are typically too ill to verbalize symptoms.Imaging (eg, ultrasonography, CT scan) that reveals gallbladder distension, wall thickening, and pericholecystic ﬂuid in the absence of gallstones supports the diagnosis. Immediate treatment includes antibiotics and percutaneous cholecystostomy. Cholecystectomy is performed once the patient's medical condition improves.

(Choice B) Duodenal perforation usually causes sudden-onset, diffuse abdominal pain. Examination typically shows peritoneal signs (eg, rigidity, rebound tenderness), and imaging typically reveals free air under the diaphragm.

(Choice C) Acute mesenteric ischemia usually presents with abdominal pain out of proportion to examination ﬁndings (eg, minimal or no tenderness). Risk factors include older age, atrial ﬁbrillation, and atherosclerotic vascular disease. Abdominal CT scan typically reveals bowel wall thickening, mesenteric stranding, and, sometimes, intestinal pneumatosis.

• B. Duodenal perforation (7%)

C. Mesenteric ischemia (20%)

(Choice D) Pancreatitis can occur when a gallstone obstructs the ﬂow of pancreatic enzymes. CT ﬁndings include an enlarged pancreas, parenchymal enhancement with intravenous contrast, and peripancreatic ﬂuid. The absence of gallstones and presence of isolated pericholecystic ﬂuid on this patient's CT scan make acalculous cholecystitis more likely than gallstone pancreatitis.

D. Pancreatitis (1%)

E. Small bowel obstruction (6%)

(Choice E) Small bowel obstruction is characterized by abdominal distension and high-pitched hyperactive bowel sounds; imaging typically reveals dilated loops of small bowel with air-ﬂuid levels and a decompressed colon and rectum. This patient's small and large bowel gaseous distension and hypoactive bowel sounds are more consistent with adynamic ileus.

Answered correctly

Acute acalculous cholecystitis is acute inﬂammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones; it is most commonly seen in critically ill patients. Imaging that reveals gallbladder distension, wall thickening, and pericholecystic ﬂuid without gallstones supports the diagnosis.

©UWorld This hemodynamically unstable patient with blunt chest and abdominal trauma and no life-threatening intrathoracic injuries has free intraperitoneal ﬂuid on Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) examination. This warrants exploratory laparotomy to control likely intraabdominal hemorrhage.

versioni

During the trauma survey of hemodynamically unstable (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) patients, the source(s) of instability should be investigated quickly. This includes ruling out rapidly fatal intrathoracic conditions (eg, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade) and identifying major sources of hemorrhage. This patient's bilateral breath sounds and lack of pericardial effusion make tension pneumothorax and tamponade unlikely, respectively. However, his distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness is concerning for intraabdominal hemorrhade due to blunt abdominal trauma (BAT).

Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

However, his distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness is concerning for intraabdominal

hemorrhage due to blunt abdominal trauma (BAT).

For patients with BAT (regardless of hemodynamic status), frank peritonitis (eg, rigidity)

warrants immediate laparotomy. In the absence of peritonitis (as in this patient), FAST examination should be performed to identify intraperitoneal free ﬂuid (eg, blood, urine, spilled enteric contents).

In hemodynamically unstable patients, a positive FAST conﬁrms signiﬁcant intraabdominal injury and therefore warrants emergent laparotomy. If FAST is negative or inconclusive, additional investigations should be considered:

• CT scan can often visualize the site and severity of intraabdominal injury but requires improved hemodynamic stability following resuscitation due to the risk of rapid deterioration in the CT scanner (Choice A).

• A. Abdominal CT scan (4%).

• B. Contrast angiography (0%).

• C. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (2%)

• Bedside diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) may be considered in patients who remain too hemodynamically unstable for CT scan despite resuscitation (Choice C).

(Choice B) Contrast angiography (with embolization) is sometimes used for BAT patients with intraabdominal hemorrhage due to splenic or hepatic laceration.However, this is only appropriate for hemodynamically stable patients with isolated, lower-grade injuries (typically identiﬁed by CT scan).

07 secs

Time Spent

(Choice E) Vasopressor therapy is contraindicated in the setting of isolated hemorrhagic shock because peripheral vascular tone is already increased (ie, vasoconstriction) to compensate for decreased blood volume. Continued volume resuscitation (eg, crystalloid, blood products) is more appropriate.

Preoperative testing (eg, ECG, chest radiography, laboratory testing) is often performed in patients before surgery due to protocols or medicolegal concerns. However, in most patients, routine testing does not improve postoperative outcomes and is unlikely to change perioperative management. In fact, preoperative tests can lead to false-positive results, increased costs, surgical delays, and higher medicolegal risks (when abnormal results go uninvestigated).

Version

Therefore, preoperative testing should be selective and based on a patient's clinical status and functional capacity, as well as the planned procedure. A complete history and physical examination are the most important routine tests to identify preexisting disease that may require preoperative evaluation. This young patient has an unremarkable medical history and physical examination. His ability to climb a ﬂight of stairs without symptoms suggests adequate functional capacity (ie, ≥4 METs), and he otherwise has a negative review of systems. As such, he can proceed to surgery without further testing.

(Choice B) Coagulation testing is frequently performed preoperatively to reveal disorders that might increase surgical bleeding risk. However, unexpected coagulation defects are rare, and bleeding history is more sensitive than tests of hemostasis in predicting perioperative bleeding

risk.

(Choice C) A complete blood count is not recommended in healthy preoperative patients. baseline hemoglobin level is suggested for patients with a history of anemia, those undergoing procedures with signiﬁcant expected blood loss, and patients age >65 scheduled for major surgery. Platelet testing is recommended before spinal anesthesia.

(Choice D) Although a complete metabolic panel provides a broad picture of metabolic function, it is unlikely to change perioperative management in healthy patients, and routine testing greatly increases the chance of a false-positive result. Most hepatic, renal, and electrolyte abnormalities can be predicted based on clinical presentation (eg, known cirrhosis, diuretic use), which should guide individual testing.

Educational objective:

Routine preoperative testing is not recommended in otherwise healthy patients. The most important routine preoperative test is a complete history and physical examination, which is used to guide further evaluation needed to reduce operative risk.

splenic injury, one of the most common intraabdominal complications of blunt abdominal

trauma (BAT).

Version

Patients with BAT who do not have frank peritonitis (an indication for immediate laparotomy) should undergo Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST). A positive FAST strongly suggests intraabdominal injury; however, a negative FAST does not rule it out because it can miss early bleeding or injuries (eg, bowel perforation) that do not produce detectable (eg, >200 mL) amounts of free ﬂuid.

A previously healthy, 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after falling approximately 3 m (10 ft) from a treehouse, landing on his left side.There was no loss of consciousness. The patient has left shoulder and left-sided chest pain, as well as abdominal pain. Blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg and pulse is 116/min. Physical examination shows bruising to the left side of the chest wall and abdomen. Heart sounds are normal. There is sharp, left-sided chest pain with deep inspiration but equal breath sounds on both sides.

The left costal margin and the left upper quadrant of the abdomen are tender to palpation. Range of motion of the left shoulder is normal. Portable chest x-ray is normal. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma shows no pericardial effusion or signiﬁcant intraperitoneal free ﬂuid. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this

patient?

For hemodynamically stable (eg, systolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg) patients with a

negative FAST:

• High suspicion of intraabdominal injury, as in this patient with tachycardia, LUQ pain, and referred shoulder pain, should prompt contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Intravenous contrast "blush" (extravasation) can often identify active bleeding.

• Low suspicion of intraabdominal injury (eg, normal vital signs, nontender abdomen) can be managed with serial physical examinations, which are performed to rule out occult injury progression (Choice A).

• A. Monitor with serial physical examinations (14%)

If operative intervention is required, every effort should be made to repair rather than remove the spleen, especially in children. If removal is unavoidable, postoperative immunization against encapsulated bacteria is mandatory.

• B. Obtain CT scan of the abdomen (59%)

• D. Obtain plain radiographs of the left shoulder (1%)

• E. Perform diagnostic peritoneal lavage (2%)

• F. Perform exploratory laparotomy (2%)

Omitted

59%

Correct answer

(Choices C and D) Splenic injury is often associated with left lower rib fractures. Although dedicated radiographs of the ribs are indicated (eg, costal margin tenderness), they are a lower priority than CT scan for ruling out active bleeding with likely splenic injury (eg, LUQ pain, referred left shoulder pain) and early shock (eg, tachycardia). Shoulder radiographs are also lower priority, especially because this patient has normal shoulder range of motion and his pain is likely referred (eg, blood irritating left phrenic nerve).

Answered correctly

01 sec

Time Spent

(Choices E and F) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage may be considered for a negative/inconclusive FAST in hemodynamically unstable patients whose condition may clinically deteriorate during CT scan. Immediate exploratory laparotomy is indicated for peritonitis (regardless of hemodynamic status) or for a positive FAST in an hemodynamically unstable patient.

2023

Version

Educational objective:

Splenic injury, one of the most common intraabdominal complications of blunt abdominal trauma (BAT), should be suspected in any patient with BAT and evidence of hemorrhage. Hemodynamically stable patients with a negative ultrasound evaluation but high-risk features should undergo CT imaging.

On arrival, blood pressure is 88/52 mm Hg and pulse is 128/min. Physical examination shows multiple contusions, including to the left side of the forehead, left arm, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, but there is no external hemorrhage. The trachea is midline. Breath sounds are present bilaterally and heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is nondistended and soft to palpation. Muscle tone is normal.

Despite initial resuscitation (2 L of crystalloid), this patient has continued hemodynamic instability (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), which is consistent with shock. Because hemorrhagic shock is the most common type of shock in the trauma setting, particular attention is given during trauma survey to areas where large blood loss can occur ("blood on the ﬂoor and 4 more"):

• External bleeding ("the ﬂoor"): up to the entire blood volume

• Chest: up to 40% of the blood volume/hemithorax

• Abdomen (ie, peritoneal cavity): up to the entire blood volume

• A. Adrenal insufﬁciency (10%)

• B. Intracranial hemorrhage (21%)

Correct answer

This patient has no evidence of external bleeding or major hemorrhage into the chest (bilateral breath sounds), abdomen (nondistended, soft, no intraperitoneal free ﬂuid), or thighs (normal muscle tone). Therefore, pelvic/retroperitoneal bleeding should be suspected. Pelvic fracture can cause tearing of the thin-walled venous plexus (presacral, lumbar), leading to life-threatening hemorrhage. For early detection of this potentially lethal injury, pelvic x-ray is typically performed as an adjunct to the trauma primary survey.

• hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg).

Because this patient already has an indication for laparotomy, the abdominal portion of the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma examination is not necessary as it does not change management.

A 20-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after falling off a trampoline. He had been drinking alcohol with some friends and began jumping on a trampoline in his neighbor's backyard. The patient tried to do a backﬂip and landed on his head. Paramedics were called and found him confused but able to follow commands. However, he was unable to move his legs or his hands. The patient was placed in spine immobilization and transported to the emergency department.On arrival, his vital signs are within normal limits, but he has increasing shortness of breath and requests to sit up to help his breathing. Chest x-ray is normal, and ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Over the next 30 minutes, his respirations become faster and shallower with more use of accessory muscles. The patient becomes sleepier and has difﬁculty responding to commands. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Explanation

This patient who fell onto his head resulting in an inability to move his legs and hands likely has cervical spine trauma. In addition, his tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and increasing somnolence are concerning for hypercapnic respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic paralysis. After a high cervical spine injury, patients are at risk for immediate diaphragmatic paralysis because the diaphragm is innervated by cervical nerve roots from C3-C5 via the

phrenic nerve. However, if the spinal cord is injured lower than C5, a delayed diaphragmatic paralysis may occur (as in this patient) due to ascending edema.

• A. Nasotracheal intubation (9%)

• B. Needle cricothyroidotomy (5%)

• C. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (6%)

As in all trauma patients, primary survey includes assessment of the airway (in addition to breathing and circulation). In patients with impending respiratory failure, the best next step in management is orotracheal intubation, even with evidence of an unstable cervical spine injury, because this procedure can be rapidly performed and is relatively noncomplex. Typically, this is done with manual stabilization of the cervical spine to minimize neck movement during intubation.

Correct answer

(Choice A) Nasotracheal intubation may be performed over a ﬁberoptic laryngoscope. However, this adds unnecessary complexity (and increased time) to this patient's management, does not decrease neck extension, and does not result in a safer airway than orotracheal

intubation.

(Choice B) Needle cricothyroidotomy can be performed when other, less invasive techniques of airway management have failed (or are likely to fail). It is used only temporarily until a more secure airway can be placed because it offers no airway protection from secretions, may lead to COz retention (and is particularly inappropriate in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure), and gives less feedback about respiratory function (eg, ventilatory volumes, pressures, gas exchange).

(Choice C) Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure) is used primarily to improve oxygenation.

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation also does not provide airway protection.

In addition to preoperative antiseptic skin preparation and sterile surgical technique, prophylactic antibiotics can help reduce surgical site infections (SSls). Administered prior to incision, prophylactic antibiotics reduce the microorganism burden at the surgical site and are indicated when there is a high risk of infection (eg, traumatic wounds) or when infection would cause signiﬁcant morbidity/mortality (eg, mediastinitis after cardiac surgery).

The speciﬁc antibiotic is chosen based on several factors, including the type of surgical wound and its expected degree of microbial contamination:

• Clean - without infection or viscus entry

• Clean-contaminated - with controlled viscus entry

• Contaminated - inﬂamed, acutely traumatic, or with viscus spillage

A 62-year-old man is hospitalized for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The patient had been having worsening exertional angina and was found to have 3-vessel coronary artery disease. His other medical conditions include hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He has had no infections and has not used antibiotics recently. The patient has a history of severe penicillin allergy causing anaphylactic shock. Blood pressure is 128/72 mm Hg and pulse is 78/min. The lungs are clear on auscultation and heart sounds are normal. Preoperative blood cell counts, serum chemistry, and coagulation studies are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most appropriate preoperative prophylactic antibiotic for this patient?

The specific antibiotic is chosen based on several factors, including the type of surgical wound

and its expected degree of microbial contamination: • Clean - without infection or viscus entry

• Clean-contaminated - with controlled viscus entry

• Contaminated - inﬂamed, acutely traumatic, or with viscus spillage

• A. Azithromycin (26%).

• B. Ciproﬂoxacin (22%)

• C. Metronidazole (3%)

• D. Piperacillin-tazobactam (8%)

• Dirty - infected, necrotic, or fecally contaminated Cardiac procedures are typically considered clean, and most associated SSis are due to skin ﬂora. Therefore, only gram-positive skin ﬂora (eg, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) coverage is required. First- and second-generation cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin) typically provide good prophylactic coverage. However, this patient has a history of a severe IgE-mediated allergic reaction (ie, anaphylactic shock) to penicillin, with which ﬁrst- and second-generation cephalosporins have structural similarities (ie, shared allergenic epitopes). Therefore, an alternative antibiotic (eg, vancomycin, clindamycin) with good gram-positive coverage should be selected.

V • E. Vancomycin (38%)

Omitted

Correct answer

(Choice A) Azithromycin has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria including atypical bacteria (eg, Mycoplasma, Legionella); it is commonly used for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. It has inferior coverage against Staphylococcus and is not typically used for SSI prophylaxis.

(Choices B and C) Ciproﬂoxacin has antimicrobial activity against aerobic, enteric, gram-negative bacilli and is used for prophylaxis in some genitourinary procedures. Metronidazole has antimicrobial activity against anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides, Clostridium) and protozoa (eg,

Trichomonas vaginalis) and is used as part of a prophylaxis regimen in some gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and genitourinary procedures. However, neither antibiotic provides adequate coverage against typical gram-positive skin flora for this cardiac procedure.

(Choice D) Piperacillin-tazobactam has antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa; it is commonly used in broad-spectrum, empiric coverage for severe infections. However, such broad coverage is unnecessary (following principles of antimicrobial stewardship) for prophylaxis against a narrower spectrum of gram-positive skin ﬂora. In addition, piperacillin-tazobactam should be avoided given this patient's severe penicillin allergy.

Prophylactic antibiotics reduce surgical site infections and are indicated when there is a high risk of infection or when infection would lead to signiﬁcant morbidity/mortality. Patients undergoing clean procedures (ie, without infection or viscus entry) should receive coverage against gram-positive skin ﬂora, ideally with a ﬁrst- or second-generation cephalosporin (eg, cefazolin) or, alternatively, with vancomycin or clindamycin.

Severe burn injuries often result in rapid development of intravascular volume depletion and shock due to both insensible ﬂuid loss (due to decreased skin integrity) and massive ﬂuid shift into the extravascular space (due to increased vascular permeability). Patients with extensive burns require aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation to maintain tissue perfusion and reduce mortality. This is accomplished with the infusion of an isotonic crystalloid solution (eg, normal saline, lactated Ringer solution [LR]), which have similar osmolality to the blood (~288 mOsm/kg H20).

mOsm/kg H2O).

Although these agents are equally effective at plasma volume expansion, LR, a balanced ﬂuid, is preferred for resuscitation in burn victims. It contains near-physiologic levels of chloride, potassium, and calcium and includes sodium lactate, a buffer that is hepatically metabolized to bicarbonate, which helps correct acidosis and maintain normal blood pH. Normal saline is considered an unbalanced ﬂuid because its chloride concentration is supraphysiologic (154 vs 103 mmol/L) and can cause a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. It has also been associated with hypocoagulability (Choice E).

• A. Dextrose 5% in water (4%)

saline (2%) • C. D. Half-normal Lactated Ringer solution (55%)

• B. Fresh frozen plasma (1%)

• E. Normal saline (36%).

(Choices A and C) Dextrose 5% in water is initially a slightly hypotonic crystalloid solution that quickly becomes markedly hypotonic with the metabolism of dextrose; it is administered to patients with a free-water deﬁcit (ie, hypernatremia). Half-normal saline is a hypotonic crystalloid that is also useful in treating hypernatremia. It is also used as a maintenance ﬂuid in those unable to maintain adequate oral hydration and may be used after this patient has been adequately resuscitated. However, these solutions must be infused slowly because the low osmolality causes much of the ﬂuid volume to shift into the intracellular space following infusion, which can result in cerebral edema.

(Choice B) Fresh frozen plasma is a colloid solution that is indicated for replacement of coagulation factors (eg, diffuse intravascular coagulation, major bleeding on warfarin, massive transfusions). Colloids are less effective and more expensive than crystalloid solutions and not indicated for resuscitation for severe burns.

Educational objective:

Burn victims frequently develop intravascular volume depletion and require aggressive resuscitation with crystalloid solutions. Lactated Ringer solution, a balanced ﬂuid, is preferred because it contains near-physiologic levels of electrolytes and includes a buffer that helps correct acidosis and maintain normal blood pH. Normal saline is associated with the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

A 63-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce for evaluation of a left breast mass.The patient noticed a small lump in the left breast a few months ago after he was struck in the chest. He expected the lump to disappear, but it has since enlarged and becomes irritated by the heavy protective vest he wears while working as a corrections ofﬁcer. Medical history is signiﬁcant for obesity, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. Physical examination shows an obese habitus with increased fatty breast tissue bilaterally. There is a 2-cm ﬁrm, ﬁxed, nontender subareolar mass in the left breast with nipple inversion. The right breast has no discrete masses. There is no axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

This older man has an enlarging left breast mass that is ﬁrm, ﬁxed, and causing nipple inversion (ie, inﬁltration into the lactiferous ducts behind the nipple). This presentation is suspicious for breast cancer and should prompt imaging (eg, mammography) followed by tissue sampling (eg, core biopsy), a workup that directly mirrors that of a palpable breast mass in a woman.

Breast cancer is less common in men than in women but shares many of the same risk factors, including increasing age and excessive estrogen stimulation (eg, increased adipose tissue aromatization of androgens to estrogens in obesity). As in this patient, most affected men have

• A. Early-morning testosterone level (1%)

a unilateral, ﬁrm, nontender subareolar mass, often with nipple involvement. The mass

B. Excision of the mass (22%)

C. Mammography (71%)

D. Serum prolactin level (3%)

E. Testicular ultrasound (1%)

may initially go undetected or it may be noted incidentally after unrelated trauma, as likely happened in this patient who noticed the lump after being struck in the chest. Although fat necrosis (which can develop after trauma) can occasionally have a similar clinical presentation, malignancy must always be ruled out ﬁrst (eg, imaging, biopsy).

Mammography is ﬁrst line for imaging, with adaptations (eg, smaller tissue compression paddles) as necessary. Breast ultrasound may also be helpful to further characterize mammographic abnormalities and aid biopsy. If suspicious features (eg, microcalciﬁcations, spiculated margins) are seen on imaging, a core biopsy is performed.

(Choices A and E) Gynecomastia, the benign proliferation of male breast glandular tissue, is caused by an increased ratio of estrogen to androgen activity, as may occur in hypogonadism (assessed via early-morning testosterone level) and some testicular germ cell tumors (assessed via testicular ultrasound). Gynecomastia can present as a ﬁrm, subareolar mass; however, it is more typically bilateral (vs unilateral), mobile (vs ﬁxed), and tender (vs nontender) during its growth phase.

(Choice B) Direct excision, without preceding imaging or biopsy, may be considered for a mass that is clearly benign on physical examination (eg, a well-circumscribed, nonﬁxed, soft lipoma). In contrast, this patient's mass has concerning features (eg, ﬁrm, ﬁxed, nipple changes) that warrant diagnosis before excision; if breast cancer is present, a more extensive surgery (eg, mastectomy) will be necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence.

A 64-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce for evaluation of a painless neck lump. The patient ﬁrst noticed right-sided neck swelling a month ago.She has not had fevers, chills, cough, or shortness of breath but has had decreased appetite and weight loss. Medical history is signiﬁcant for obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 29 years.She drinks alcohol socially. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a 2-cm, hard, nontender cervical lymph node close to the right submandibular gland. There is no other lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation and heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is soft and nontender; mild hepatomegaly is present. The remainder of the examination is normal. Fine-needle aspiration of the lymph node reveals squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following would be most helpful to establish the primary source of this patient's malignancy?

Explanation

Malignancy is extremely likely in a patient with a persistent (>2 weeks), palpable (>1.5 cm), ﬁrm neck mass, who has a smoking history and no history of a preceding infection. By far the most common malignancy to manifest in an upper cervical lymph node is mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Head and neck SCC is common in patients with a signiﬁcant history of alcohol and tobacco use (as in this patient). The ﬁrst (and only) apparent manifestation is often a palpable cervical lymph node, which represents regional nocal metastasis

A. Abdominal CT scan (9%)

Identiﬁcation of the primary source of SCC is of paramount importance because it directs all treatment decisions. Although SCC can originate from many sites (eg, skin, uterine cervix, upper esophagus), the vast majority of cervical nodal SCC arises from the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck (ie, nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx). Thorough examination of these structures must include endoscopic visualization using laryngopharyngoscopy.

• C. Colonoscopy (1%)

• D. Laryngopharyngoscopy (81%)

• E. Liver biopsy (1%)

• F. Thyroid ultrasound (2%)

(Choices A and C) Abdominal malignancies (eg, stomach, pancreas, colon, ovaries) can spread via the thoracic duct to the left supraclavicular lymph nodes (Virchow node)-an ominous sign. However, most of these abdominal malignancies are adenocarcinomas rather than SCC. In addition, submandibular lymphadenopathy (as seen in this patient) reﬂects lymphatic drainage from the head and neck rather than the thoracic duct, making abdominal malignancy less likely.

(Choice B) Although breast cancer commonly affects the axillary and internal mammary lymph nodes, it occasionally metastasizes to the cervical nodes.

Explanation

A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen during a home invasion. The event occurred 45 minutes prior to arrival. Because of hypotension, paramedics administered 1 L of normal saline en route to the emergency department. On arrival, blood pressure is 98/62 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 22/min. The patient is awake and moaning in pain. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and heart sounds are normal. One bullet wound is noted in the left upper quadrant. The abdomen is tender and distended. The patient is moving all his extremities, but they are cool and clammy. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma examination shows free ﬂuid in the abdomen. Continuation of additional normal saline ﬂuid boluses in this patient would likely result in which of the following?

This patient with penetrating abdominal trauma has signs of hemorrhagic shock (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, cool extremities) and, likely, ongoing hemorrhage (eg, free intraperitoneal ﬂuid on Focused Assessment with Sonograph for Trauma). Such patients once received early, aggressive crystalloid (eg, normal saline) resuscitation to restore intravascular volume and normal blood pressure. Now, balanced resuscitation (aka, damage-control resuscitation) is used; it includes the following measures:

• Limiting use of crystalloids (eg, <1 L), which dilute existing coagulation (eg, clotting)

• A. Decreased risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (12%)

B. Decreased risk for hypothermia (20%)

C. Increased risk for coagulopathy (37%)

D. Increased risk for metabolic alkalosis (28%)

factors and platelets, thereby increasing coagulopathy • Replacing lost intravascular volume with blood products (rather than crystalloids), transfused in a ratio similar to that of whole blood (eg, 1:1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells/plasma/platelets)

• Permitting hypotension (ie, permissive hypotension) to limit ongoing hemorrhage and/or prevent clot disruption and rebleeding

Omitted

Correct answer

2023

With balanced resuscitation, blood products are administered only as needed to maintain a blood pressure (eg, mean arterial pressure ~65 mm Hg) sufﬁcient for tissue perfusion, until deﬁnitive hemorrhage control (eg, surgical intervention) can be achieved.

In addition to coagulopathy, aggressive crystalloid resuscitation has been associated with the following detrimental effects:

Version

• Hypothermia: Room temperature ﬂuids are cooler than body temperature and can cause hypothermia (which worsens coagulopathy), especially when administered in large

volumes (Choice B).

• Acidosis: Large volumes of rapidly administered normal saline can cause non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (vs alkalosis), which can further worsen the performance of coagulation factors (Choice D).

• Increased mortality: Overuse of crystalloids worsens the "lethal triad" (hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy) already present in severely injured trauma patients, increasing the risk for mortality.

(Choice A) The trauma-induced inﬂammatory response can cause capillary leakage and diffuse pulmonary edema, sometimes resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Crystalloids have been shown to cause a dose-dependent increase (vs decrease) in ARDS; they have a lower oncotic pressure than blood and can leak more easily into the pulmonary interstitium.

Large-volume crystalloid resuscitation increases coagulopathy, hypothermia, and mortality in trauma patients. Balanced resuscitation, which restricts crystalloid use and uses blood products to maintain a blood pressure just sufﬁcient for tissue perfusion (ie, permissive hypotension) until hemorrhage is controlled, can decrease these adverse effects.

10 g/dL 180,000/mm3 1,900/mm3

EBV is an oncogenic virus because it produces proteins (eg, latent membrane protein) that lead to B-cell proliferation and generates prosurvival nuclear transcription factors (EBNA) that lead to B-cell immortalization.Subsequent cell spread through the reticuloendothelial system results in lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow inﬁltration (eg, leukopenia, anemia), and/or B-symptoms. Diagnosis is often suspected due to a markedly elevated EBV titer, but biopsy may be required for conﬁrmation.

(Choice A) Graft versus host disease occurs in patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, not solid-organ transplantation. It occurs when donor cells attack host tissue because they do not recognize the human leukocyte antigens on the host cell surface. Patients often develop skin, biliary tract, and gastrointestinal disease. Lymphadenopathy is not typical.

Echocardiogram shows normal heart structure and function. A CT scan of the chest reveals scattered bilateral atelectasis and several highly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

C. Proliferation of immortal B cells (59%)

• D. Recurrent viral myocarditis (9%)

(Choice B) Pneumocystis pneumonia is common in patients with deﬁcits in cell-mediated immunity due to immunosuppressive medications. Patients typically have progressive respiratory failure with bilateral reticulonodular pulmonary inﬁltrates and profound hypoxia. Although lactate dehydrogenase levels are often elevated, lymphadenopathy is not common.

(Choice D) Viral myocarditis often causes chest pain, arrhythmia, or heart failure; a second episode of viral myocarditis is uncommon, may cause heart abnormalities (eg, wall dysfunction, pericardial effusion) that could be identiﬁed on echocardiogram, and is unlikely to explain cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

E. Transplant rejection (6%)

(Choice E) Heart transplant rejection is generally marked by signiﬁcant echocardiogram abnormalities (eg, reduced left ventricular ejection); lymphadenopathy is atypical.

This patient's arm swelling, pain, and mild erythema developed in the setting of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), raising strong suspicion for upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). All upper extremity central catheters (eg, internal jugular, subclavian) are associated with increased risk of DVT due to endothelial trauma during insertion and improper positioning of the catheter tip; the risk of DVT is somewhat higher with PICCs because they travel long distances through narrow peripheral veins (often occupying >50% of total vein caliber). Hospitalized patients, particularly those with a hypercoagulable state (eg, malignancy), are most likely to develop PICC-related DVT.

Upper extremity DVT is most common within 7-14 days of PICC insertion. The primary manifestation is arm or forearm swelling. Pain and mild erythema may also occur. In contrast to PICC infection, patients with DVT usually have a normal appearing catheter insertion site (eg, no purulence).

A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being stepped on by a bull

Explanation

approximately 30 minutes ago. The patient was bucked off of the bull, whose hind feet landed on his chest. On arrival, blood pressure is 75/50 mm Hg, pulse is 140/min, and respirations are 24/min. On examination, the patient moans in pain but does not answer questions. Two hoof prints are seen in the middle of the chest. He has decreased bilateral breath sounds, and crepitus is present over the anterior chest walls bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and nondistended. There is no obvious injury to the extremities, but they are cool, and capillary reﬁll is decreased. Bilateral chest tubes are immediately placed, and 1.5 L of blood is returned from each side. Vital signs do not improve after placement of chest tubes. Four units of packed red blood cells are prepared for transfusion. What other blood products, if any, should also be administered at this time?

This patient with a severe crush injury to the chest has signs of hemorrhagic shock (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, altered mental status, decreased capillary reﬁll) from a noncompressible (intrathoracic) site (ie, bleeding source cannot be controlled by compression or tourniquet). Hemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of death in acute traumatic injuries, and this patient likely needs massive transfusions (eg, >3 units in 30 min) until deﬁnitive hemorrhage control can be obtained in the operating room.

Massive transfusion protocols, developed to standardize resuscitation, are likely required in patients with ≥2 of the following:

• Penetrating mechanism of injury

A. 4 units of cryoprecipitate only (3%)

B. 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 4 units of platelets (52%)

The appropriate proportions and types of blood products should be carefully considered to optimize volume status and tissue oxygenation and to reduce acid-base abnormalities and coagulopathy. Administering blood products in a 1:1:1 ratio of fresh frozen plasma [FFP]/packed red blood cells/platelets mitigates coagulopathy. Trauma itself can lead to coagulopathy due to dysregulation and inﬂammation. Coagulopathy can occur due to acidosis

optimize volume status and tissue oxygenation and to reduce acid-base abnormalities and coagulopathy. Administering blood products in a 1:1:1 ratio of fresh frozen plasma [FFP]/packed red blood cells/platelets mitigates coagulopathy. Trauma itself can lead to coagulopathy due to dysregulation and inﬂammation. Coagulopathy can occur due to acidosis (hypoperfusion), hypothermia (transfusion of cold intravenous solutions), hemodilution (eg, clotting factor dilution), and factor consumption. If available, whole blood (packed red blood cells + plasma) is an alternative to the 1:1:1 ratio.

Adjunct therapies for hemorrhagic shock include tranexamic acid (antiﬁbrinolytic agent), which is effective in a subset of patients with acute life-threatening hemorrhage if administered within the ﬁrst 3 hours of injury, and topical hemostatic agents (eg, kaolin-impregnated sponge, ﬁbrin sealant dressing), which are applied to control external hemorrhage.

(Choices A, C, D, and E) Administering more of one type of blood product dilutes the circulating amount of the others and increases coagulopathy risk. FFP (containing all clotting factors and plasma proteins) alone is usually considered for severe coagulopathy (eg, liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation) with active bleeding, some cases of warfarininduced bleeding, or some inherited coagulopathies.Platelets are typically transfused for a platelet count < 10,000/mm' (risk of spontaneous hemorrhage) or a platelet count <50,000/mm3 with active bleeding. Cryoprecipitate is considered with low ﬁbrinogen (eg, < 100 mg/dL).

Educational objective:

Blood products should be administered early in patients with signs of hemorrhagic shock. They should be administered in a ratio of 1:1:1 (fresh frozen plasma/packed red blood cells/platelets) to reduce coagulopathy, a leading contributor to mortality in trauma patients.

• Overactivation of the coagulation cascade, leading to the formation of ﬁbrin- and plateletrich thrombi and the consumption of coagulation factors (prolonged PT/PTT), platelets (thrombocytopenia), and ﬁbrinogen.

• Subsequent ﬁbrinolysis (to break up the clots), which increases ﬁbrin degradation products (eg, D-dimer). Anticoagulation proteins (eg, protein C/S) are also consumed.

Deﬁciency is rare in healthy individuals and takes several weeks or months (not a day) to develop. Most cases arise in patients with disorders of the pancreas/biliary system (because vitamin K is fat-soluble) or in those who take prolonged courses of antibiotics.

A 56-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis comes to the hospital for elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to evaluate for esophageal varices.The patient has elevated liver aminotransferase levels, and a hepatitis serology was positive for chronic hepatitis C. Abdominal imaging studies revealed mild ascites, a nodular-appearing liver, and splenomegaly. He has no other medical problems. The patient has a remote history of injection drug use and does not use tobacco or alcohol. Vital signs are within normal limits. Benzocaine throat spray is used for topical anesthesia, and procedural sedation is obtained with midazolam and fentanyl. During the procedure, the patient's oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry gradually decreases to 85% on ambient air and does not improve with application of supplemental oxygen via face mask. Physical examination demonstrates bluish discoloration of the lips and ﬁngertips. Lung ﬁelds are clear to auscultation, and heart sounds are normal. Results of urgent laboratory tests are as follows:

Hematocrit

Explanation

This patient has new-onset hypoxia by pulse oximetry (85%) during an endoscopic procedure, with a signiﬁcant difference between the oxygen saturation value estimated on blood gas

analysis and that obtained on pulse oximetry (ie, large oxygen saturation gap). He likely has acquired methemoglobinemia due to anesthetic use.

Arterial blood gases

Some medications - most commonly topical anesthetics (eg, benzocaine), dapsone, and nitrates (in infants) - cause the iron component of hemoglobin to be oxidized, thereby forming methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen. The remaining normal hemoglobin also has an increased afﬁnity for oxygen, resulting in less oxygen delivery to tissues. Because methemoglobin absorbs light at distinct wavelengths, pulse oximetry commonly is ~85% (as seen in this patient) regardless of the true oxygen saturation. In parallel, blood gas analysis frequently returns a falsely elevated result for oxygen saturation (eg, 99% in this patient) as it provides an estimate based only on the PaOz, not on effective hemoglobin-oxygen binding. These inaccurate readings create the large oxygen saturation gap.

Treatment involves discontinuing the causative agent and administering methylene blue, which helps reduce iron to its normal state.

A 35-year-old woman undergoes core needle biopsy for a suspicious, asymptomatic thyroid nodule that was discovered during a routine physical examination. TSH is normal. After the procedure, the patient develops an expanding hematoma at the biopsy site. She has no personal or family history of bleeding or easy bruising. Which of the following is the most

likely diagnosis?

Explanation

• A. Dysfunctional platelets (15%)

• B. Factor VIII deﬁciency (4%)

C. Insufﬁcient hemostasis (64%)

D. Thrombocytopenia (7%)

• E. Vitamin C deﬁciency (1%)

• F. Vitamin K deﬁciency (7%)

This patient developed a hematoma after core needle biopsy for an asymptomatic thyroid nodule. She has no personal or family history of easy bleeding or bruising, making vitamin deﬁciency and most hereditary bleeding disorders unlikely. Therefore, despite a core needle biopsy being a fairly low-risk procedure, the most likely explanation for the hematoma is insufﬁcient hemostasis following tissue injury from the biopsy.

(Choice A) Platelet dysfunction can be seen in patients who take antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin) or have certain comorbid conditions (eg, liver disease, uremia). Von Willebrand disease can affect platelet function. This otherwise healthy individual (with no family history of bleeding) is unlikely to have platelet dysfunction. Furthermore, most cases would manifest immediately with oozing at the biopsy site.

(Choice D) Clinically signiﬁcant thrombocytopenia (eg, primary immune thrombocytopenia) usually manifests with a history of bruising and mucocutaneous bleeding.

(Choices E and F) Although vitamin C deﬁciency (scurvy) can increase the risk of bleeding due to blood vessel fragility, and vitamin K deﬁciency can increase the risk of bleeding due to coagulation factor (eg, factor II, VII, IX, X) deﬁciency, this patient's lack of mucocutaneous bruising or bleeding makes these conditions unlikely. In addition, healthy individuals who consume a relatively normal diet are at very low risk for vitamin deﬁciency.

Insufﬁcient hemostasis is the most common cause of postoperative hematoma in patients with no personal or family history of easy bleeding or bruising.

RSH typically occurs due to rupture of the inferior epigastric artery, which supplies blood to the lower aspect of the rectus abdominis muscle. The rectus sheath, which contains this muscle, does not extend posteriorly below the arcuate line; therefore, bleeding below this line (eg, lower aspect of rectus abdominis muscle) is relatively uncontained and can result in signiﬁcant hemorrhage with hematoma formation. RSH is often seen with blunt trauma or forceful abdominal contractions (eg, severe coughing), particularly in patients receiving

anticoagulation therapy.

A 55-year-old woman undergoes allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched, unrelated donor for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. She received

conditioning chemotherapy prior to the transplantation, and her immediate post-transplant course was uncomplicated. However, 3 weeks after the transplant, the patient develops worsening crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea. The diarrhea is watery and persistent, even at night, with output up to 3 liters daily. No particular food makes the symptoms better or worse. Medications include tacrolimus, prophylactic acyclovir, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and voriconazole. The patient has no other chronic medical conditions. She has been in the hospital since the transplantation and is on a low-microbial diet. Physical examination shows generalized maculopapular rash. Stool testing for Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile and PCR testing for cytomegalovirus are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's diarrhea?

Explanation

This patient's profuse, watery diarrhea and maculopapular rash raise strong suspicion for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), an immune-mediated, multisystem inﬂammatory condition that occurs in 35%-50% of patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Acute GVHD arises when donor T cells (particularly cytotoxic T cells) identify antigens on host epithelial cells as foreign and subsequently generate a strong proinﬂammatory response.

Patients with acute GVHD generally develop symptoms within 100 days of transplantation, including the following:

• Maculopapular rash that is often painful and can become conﬂuent (resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome)

A. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (12%)

B. CD8+ T-lymphocyte mediated injury (39%)

A 55-year-old woman undergoes allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched, unrelated donor for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. She received

conditioning chemotherapy prior to the transplantation, and her immediate post-transplant course was uncomplicated. However, 3 weeks after the transplant, the patient develops worsening crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea. The diarrhea is watery and persistent, even at night, with output up to 3 liters daily. No particular food makes the symptoms better or worse. Medications include tacrolimus, prophylactic acyclovir, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and voriconazole. The patient has no other chronic medical conditions. She has been in the hospital since the transplantation and is on a low-microbial diet. Physical examination shows generalized maculopapular rash. Stool testing for Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difﬁcile and PCR testing for cytomegalovirus are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's diarrhea?

Correct answer

(Choice D) Conditioning chemotherapy is administered prior to transplantation to destroy active immune cells (immunoablative) or to destroy hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow to create room for transplanted stem cells (myeloablative). Although chemotherapy is often associated with a few days of nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal side effects generally resolve within a week; symptoms 3 weeks later would be very atypical.

(Choice E) Patients who undergo solid organ or HSCT are at increased risk for lymphoproliferative disorders. Most cases present many years (not weeks) after transplantation with extranodal or CNS lesions. Profuse watery diarrhea and a maculopapular rash would be atypical.

Acute graft-versus-host disease is a common complication of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It arises when donor T-lymphocytes recognize antigens on host epithelial cells as foreign and initiate a strong inﬂammatory response. Patients usually manifest symptoms within 100 days of transplant, including a maculopapular rash; profuse, watery diarrhea; and signs of hepatobiliary inﬂammation.

This patient has multiple sites for blood loss: hemothorax (decreased breath sounds, 1.5 L of blood from chest tube), hemoperitoneum (tender abdomen, positive focused assessment with sonography for trauma [FAST] examination), and femur fracture (left thigh deformity). In the setting of blood loss, a systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mm Hg, along with tachycardia >120/min, altered mental status (eyes closed, moaning), and delayed capillary reﬁll (cold, clammy extremities), suggests at least 30% loss of circulating blood volume, generally classiﬁed as class Ill hemorrhage. This presentation is consistent with hemorrhagic shock from bleeding at noncompressible sites (chest and abdomen).

2023

version

Type-speciﬁc blood is the optimal choice for transfusion; however, depending on several factors (eg, trauma vs nontrauma center, presence of antibodies), it can take signiﬁcant (eg, >20 min) time to prepare (eg, after type and cross-matching). Patients in hemorrhagic shock, such as this one, can exsanguinate in that time (Choice E). Therefore, in such situations, group O, Rh D-negative blood should be administered unless type-speciﬁc blood is immediately available.

Therefore, in such situations, group O, Rh D-negative blood should be administered unless type-speciﬁc blood is immediately available.

Most hospitals keep O Rh D-negative blood (universal donor) ready for use in emergencies. To prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn in future pregnancies, it is particularly important that this type of blood be given to women of childbearing age, as in this patient, and to young girls. In men and in women past childbearing age, O Rh D-positive blood can be given (Choice D).

When there is concern for massive transfusion requirements (eg, SBP ≤90/mm Hg, pulse ≥120/min, positive FAST, penetrating mechanism of injury), blood products should be given in a 1:1:1 fresh frozen plasma/packed red blood cells/platelets ratio to minimize risk of coagulopathy (eg, widespread tissue damage, lactic acidosis).

(Choice A) In acutely injured trauma patients, excess crystalloid use exacerbates the lethal, trauma-induced triad of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy, increasing mortality.

(Choice B) Vasopressors are appropriate for patients with severe peripheral vasodilation due to distributive (eg, septic, neurogenic) shock. Patients with hemorrhagic shock should receive volume resuscitation with blood transfusion while awaiting deﬁnitive management of the hemorrhage (eg, surgical intervention). Vasopressor administration without appropriate resuscitation can worsen tissue perfusion.

This patient likely has an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, a rare but life-threatening reaction typically caused by transfusion of mismatched blood (ie, ABO incompatibility), secondary to clerical error. Pathogenesis involves recipient antibodies reacting with donor blood antigens, causing complement ﬁxation and hemolysis as well as a proinﬂammatory

reaction.

Therefore, patients develop fever, chills, and hypotension within 1 hour after transfusion initiation; nonspeciﬁc ﬂank pain is also characteristic. Hemolysis causes hemoglobinuria and may lead to acute renal failure (due to acute tubular necrosis), disseminated intravascular coagulation (eg, bleeding from intravenous site, as in this patient), and shock.

Correct answer

(Choice B) Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions result from an anamnestic antibody response to a red blood cell antigen to which the patient was previously sensitized (eg, pregnancy). In contrast to this case, patients typically develop extravascular hemolysis days to weeks after transfusion.

(Choice C) Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection (TTBI), due to bacterial contamination of blood products, is characterized by fever, tachycardia, and hypotension around 30 minutes after transfusion completion. Flank pain is not associated with TTBI. In addition, TTBI most commonly occurs with platelet (rather than red blood cell) transfusions because platelets are stored at room temperature, which increases their susceptibility to bacterial growth.

Answered correctly

1) 01 sec Time Spent

(Choice D) Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction is a common, benign reaction that occurs within 1-6 hours after transfusion due to the release of accumulated cytokines in stored blood. Patients develop transient fever and chills. Hypotension and ﬂank pain do not occur.

2023

version

(Choice E) Individuals with IgA deﬁciency are at risk of developing anaphylactic reaction to blood products due to preformed anti-lgA antibodies (IgE or IgG) that react against donor blood IgA. Angioedema, hypotension, and respiratory distress (eg, wheezing) occur within minutes after transfusion initiation. This patient's fever and lack of wheezing or rash make anaphylaxis

less likely. Educational objective:

Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is an uncommon, life-threatening reaction due to transfusion of mismatched blood (eg, ABO incompatibility), which causes fever, ﬂank pain, and hemoglobinuria within 1 hour of transfusion initiation. Continued hemolysis can lead to acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and shock.

The patient denies the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. Temperature is 36.1 C (97 F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 14/min. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. The patient is awake, alert, and in no distress. No masses are palpable in the neck. Heart and lungs sounds are normal. CT scan of the chest reveals a large, anterior mediastinal mass causing tracheal compression. Serum levels of alpha fetoprotein and ß-hCG are elevated. Which of the following is the most likely

diagnosis?

Explanation

This patient has a large, anterior mediastinal mass that is causing cough, shortness of breath, and postural wheezing due to mass-effect compression of other mediastinal structures, including the trachea. The differential diagnosis of anterior mediastinal masses includes the 4 Ts: thymoma, teratoma (and other germ cell tumors [GCTs]), "terrible" lymphoma, and thyroid neoplasm. When serum hormone levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and B-hCG are elevated, a

malignant GCT is likely.

Malignant GCTs occur predominantly in young men and can usually be distinguished by differences in serum hormone levels:

• A. High-grade lymphoma (3%)

B. Mixed germ cell tumor (65%)

• Seminomas, which are more common than nonseminomatous GCTs, may cause elevated serum B-hCG in a minority of cases, but AFP is almost always normal (Choice

C).

C. Seminoma (15%)

D. Small cell neuroendocrine tumor (2%)

E. Thymoma (12%)

A 24-year-old Indian man comes to the emergency department due to 3 days of left upper quadrant abdominal pain. The pain began after he ﬂew back from India, where he was visiting family. He has had no fever, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He does not use tobacco or alcohol regularly, but on the ﬂight back to the United States, he had some alcohol to help him sleep. He has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. Temperature is 37.3 C (99.1 F), blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, pulse is 96/min, and respirations are 16/min. Pulse oximetry is 97% on room air. Mucous membranes are moist, and there is no jugular venous distension or palpable lymphadenopathy. Cardiopulmonary auscultation is normal. Abdominal examination reveals left upper quadrant tenderness with no rigidity or rebound guarding. Bowel sounds are present, and there is no hepatosplenomegaly. There is no lower extremity edema or skin rashes. Laboratory results are as follows:

Complete blood count Hemoglobin

2.5%

Reticulocytes Platelets

220,000/mm3 10,400/mm3

Leukocytes

Liver function studies Indirect bilirubin 1.7 mg/dL

Abdominal ultrasound shows normal liver size, but the spleen is slightly enlarged with a hypoechoic wedge consistent with an infarction. Which of the following would be most helpful in determining the underlying cause of his current condition?

Explanation

This patient underwent a long plane ﬂight and developed a splenic infarction, an uncommon condition that usually arises in the setting of acute splenic artery (or subbranch) occlusion; possible underlying etiologies include a hypercoagulable state, embolic disease, or hemoglobinopathy. In this patient, a mild hemoglobinopathy such as sickle cell trait is most likely given the mild intravascular hemolysis (eg, elevated reticulocyte count, indirect hyperbilirubinemia), normal hemoglobin level, and negative past medical history for pain crises (making sickle cell disease unlikely).

Sickle hemoglobin mutations are often linked to Sub-Saharan Africa but are also common in other regions that have a high burden of malaria, including Central/South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and India. Most patients with sickle cell trait (eg, one altered beta-hemoglobin chain) are asymptomatic and considered benign carriers; however, certain stressors, such as ﬂying at high altitude or dehydration due to alcohol consumption, can sometimes lead to intravascular hemolysis, tissue ischemia (eg, splenic infarction), and/or vasoocclusive pain. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is diagnostic.

(Choice A) 24-hour ECG monitoring can diagnose atrial ﬁbrillation, which can cause splenic infarction due to atrial thromboembolism. However, atrial ﬁbrillation would be unusual in a 24year-old and does not typically cause reticulocytosis or bilirubinemia.

Splenic infarction usually occurs in the setting of splenic artery (or subbranch) occlusion due to hypercoagulable states, embolic disease, or hemoglobinopathy (eg, sickle cell disease or trait). Although patients with sickle cell trait are generally asymptomatic, they occasionally develop splenic infarction and intravascular hemolysis in the setting of certain stressors such as air travel or dehydration. Diagnosis of most hemoglobinopathies is made by hemoglobin electrophoresis.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life-threatening complication of heparin therapy. Heparin induces a conformational change in a platelet surface protein (platelet factor 4), which exposes a neoantigen. In patients with HIT, HIT antibodies form in response to the neoantigen and bind to the surface of platelets, causing platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia (or drop in platelets >50%), and a prothrombotic state. In patients receiving heparin subcutaneously (eg, enoxaparin), a classic thrombotic complication of HIT is skin necrosis at the abdominal injection site.

version

HIT is diagnosed by immunoassay (only if high titer) or functional assay (eg, serotonin release assay [gold standard]). Treatment involves immediately discontinuing all heparin products (including heparin ﬂushes) and initiating an alternate anticoagulant (eg, argatroban, fondaparinux). If HIT is suspected, treatment should not be delayed for laboratory conﬁrmation as the risk of venous and arterial thrombosis is as high as 50% in untreated HIT.

(Choice A) Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that can cause an acquired protein C deﬁciency, which may manifest as skin necrosis. However, this patient has not received any oral anticoagulation.

A. Acquired deﬁciency of protein C (11%)

B. Antibodies against a platelet component (61%)

C. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (7%)

(Choice C) Delayed hypersensitivity reactions typically cause skin erythema, vesicles, or bullae. More severe reactions are associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever. This patient has necrotic lesions likely at the site of her low-molecular-weight heparin injections, making HIT much more likely.

• D. Embolization of cholesterol (17%).

• E. Reactivation of a latent virus (1%)

(Choice D) Cholesterol embolization can occur due to plaque embolization into small arteries following coronary angiography. Cholesterol embolization classically causes skin ﬁndings (eg, livedo reticularis [mottled erythema], gangrene, cyanosis) that most commonly affect the lower extremities. With necrotic lesions on the abdominal wall, HIT is much more likely.

Platelet counts typically normalize 2-7 days after stopping heparin; transfusions are not required unless the patient is overtly bleeding (which is uncommon in HIT).

F. Switch to low molecular weight heparin (7%)

lime soent

(Choice E) Warfarin is used for anticoagulation maintenance in patients with HIT but only after the patient has received another anticoagulant and the platelet count is > 150,000/mm3. Initial treatment with warfarin is contraindicated in patients with HIT as it rapidly lowers protein C levels, which may transiently increase the risk of thrombus.

Answerea correculy

(Choice F) All heparin products, including low molecular weight heparin, should be avoided in patients with HIT.

Version

Educational objective:

Suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia requires immediate cessation of all forms of

heparin and initiation of anticoagulation with an alternate agent (eg, argatroban, fondaparinux). Once the platelet count is > 150,000/mm', most patients can be switched safely to warfarin.

A 48-year-old, previously healthy woman is brought to the emergency department after being crushed between cars. She works at a car wash, where her legs and abdomen were pinned between a car exiting the wash bay and a parked car. On arrival, blood pressure is 74/32 mm Hg and pulse is 118/min. Physical examination shows obvious lower extremity deformity and severe pelvic tenderness. Further evaluation reveals multiple fractures of the pelvis and the shaft of the right femur. The patient rapidly receives 4 L of intravenous ﬂuid and 4 units of packed red blood cells. Repeat blood pressure is 106/58 mm Hg and pulse is 104/min. Urgent operative ﬁxation of the pelvic and femur fractures is planned. Preoperative laboratory results are as follows:

Explanation

This patient with serious pelvic trauma leading to blood loss anemia requiring large-volume transfusion now has thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT/PTT, and normal ﬁbrinogen and D-dimer levels. Although traumatic injury is a common trigger for consumptive coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation), this condition is marked by the widespread deposition of ﬁbrin- and platelet-rich thrombi, which rapidly consumes ﬁbrinogen and is associated with Ddimer elevation (Choice D). Given this patient's normal ﬁbrinogen and D-dimer levels, the most likely explanation for her coagulation abnormalities is the dilutional effect of large-

Packed red blood cells restore blood volume and improve oxygen-carrying capacity but contain minimal platelets and clotting factors. Therefore, the administration of large volumes of packed red blood cells (generally ≥4 units in 30 minutes or ≥10 units during hospitalization) can dilute circulating clotting factors, leading to prolonged PT/PTT, and platelets, leading to mild thrombocytopenia.

This patient with a history of injection drug use has right leg edema, erythema, and warmth. Although these symptoms often occur in a localized manner in injection drug users due to skin and soft tissue infection, the presence of symptoms in the entire leg, increased thigh and calf diameters, and injection marks in the right groin raises strong suspicion for acute iliofemoral

deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

Common risk factors for ﬁrst DVT include prolonged immobility or hospitalization, recent major surgery, obesity, malignancy, oral contraceptive/hormone replacement use, and pregnancy. However, patients who inject drugs into the femoral vein also are at high risk for DVT due to iliofemoral venous wall trauma, chemical irritation, and/or infection.

Manifestations of lower extremity DVT generally include unilateral leg swelling, pain, and warmth; physical examination often reveals dilated superﬁcial veins and increased diameter of the calf or thigh when compared to the unaffected leg. Initial evaluation typically includes D-dimer (in those with low or moderate pretest probability) and/or lower extremity Doppler ultrasound examination (in those with high pretest probability).

• C. Lymphatic ﬁlariasis (3%)

A. Acute lymphangitis (34%)

B. Deep venous thrombosis (48%)

• D. Lymphogranuloma venereum (4%)

• E. Necrotizing myositis (8%)

(Choice A) Acute lymphangitis is a common complication of injection drug use due to inoculation of skin ﬂora into subcutaneous tissue. However, this condition is generally marked by tender red streaks up the lymphatic channels with painful, swollen, erythematous regional lymphadenitis. The presence of diffuse right leg symptoms and increased calf or thigh diameter enlargement makes DVT far more likely.

(Choice C) Chronic lymphatic ﬁlariasis often results in limb lymphedema due to long-standing lymphatic inﬂammation. However, most cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the Indian subcontinent. In addition, this patient with injection marks in the right groin is far more likely to have acute DVT due to iliofemoral vein injury.

(Choice E) Necrotizing myositis is a rare condition generally marked by severe systemic toxicity (eg, high fever, hypotension, toxic appearance) and rapidly progressive skin changes (eg, discoloration, gangrene). This patient's normal vital signs and slow-onset symptoms make this highly unlikely.

Educational objective:

Patients who inject drugs into the femoral vein can develop iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis. This disorder is typically marked by unilateral leg edema, warmth, and erythema with evidence of dilated superﬁcial veins and increased calf/thigh diameter on examination.

A 64-year-old man undergoes an emergency colonic resection for extensive ischemic colitis. He lives alone and consumes large amounts of alcohol. His family history is noncontributory. The patient is extubated on the 4th postoperative day. After extubation, he has episodes of confusion and agitation treated with lorazepam and haloperidol. He is also receiving piperacillin with tazobactam. The patient has had nothing by mouth since the surgery. On postoperative day 7, the nurse notices bleeding from a venipuncture site. His temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 121/76 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. Laboratory results are as follows:

This patient's clinical presentation suggests an acquired bleeding disorder, most likely due to vitamin K deﬁciency. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in hemostasis by serving as a cofactor in the enzymatic carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on prothrombin complex proteins. The body obtains vitamin K exogenously from intestinal absorption of dietary Vitamin K and endogenously from bacterial production of vitamin K in the intestine. Vitamin K deﬁciency is most commonly due to inadequate dietary intake, intestinal malabsorption, or hepatocellular disease causing loss of storage sites. The liver can normally store a 30-day supply of vitamin K, but an acutely ill person with underlying liver disease can become vitamin K deﬁcient in as little as 7-10 days.

This patient received no enteral nutrition postoperatively and was given a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and so both natural sources of vitamin K were compromised. In addition, he also likely has alcoholic liver disease, further limiting his vitamin K stores. Vitamin K deﬁciency decreases plasma levels of all the prothrombin complex proteins (factors 2, 7, 9, 10, and protein C and S). This initially increases the prothrombin time (PT), followed by prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

A 50-year-old woman is evaluated in the post-anesthesia care unit due to sudden onset of severe nausea and right ﬂank pain. The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and tumor debulking for metastatic ovarian cancer.The procedure was complicated by bleeding and a ureteral laceration that was repaired intraoperatively.Immediately afterwards, her hemoglobin level was 6.8 g/dL. A packed red blood cell transfusion was initiated 10 minutes ago. Now, in addition to nausea and right ﬂank pain, she has developed pain and oozing along the IV site. Temperature is 38.5 C (101.3 F), blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 26/min. Cardiac examination reveals tachycardia with weak pulses. The lungs are clear bilaterally. The skin examination is normal. The urine is dark red. Which of the following would most likely establish the diagnosis in this patient?

This patient with fever, ﬂank pain, and dark red urine 10 minutes after transfusion is having an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR), a rare but potentially fatal reaction due to transfusion of mismatched blood (eg, ABO incompatibility). The most common etiology is clerical error (eg, patient misidentiﬁcation).

Version

Answerea correculy

lime soent

AHTR typically occurs within minutes to hours of transfusion due to host antibodies attacking donor blood antigens. The result is massive red blood cell destruction (ie, intravascular hemolysis), which leads to toxic hemoglobin buildup in the kidney, renal tubular cell injury, and subsequent acute renal failure. Therefore, ﬁndings that raise suspicion for AHTR include ﬂank pain and dark red urine (ie, hemoglobinuria) as well as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension (due to inﬂammatory cytokine release) shortly following a transfusion. Patients may also have elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (from hemolysis) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (eg, oozing intravenous site).

Diagnosis of AHTR is with a positive direct Coombs test, reﬂecting antibody-coated red blood cells. Management includes immediate cessation of transfusion, aggressive intravenous ﬂuid administration, and supportive care.

C. Direct Coombs test (65%)

(Choice A) Blood culture and antibiotics are indicated for a transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection (TTBI) or for urinary tract infection (UTI), which can present with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. However, TTBI typically develops over hours (not minutes), and ﬂank pain and hemoglobinuria are usually not present. UTI can cause ﬂank pain (eg, pyelonephritis) and hematuria, but AHTR is a much more likely explanation of this patient's sudden-onset hypotension and acute disseminated intravascular coagulation within minutes of a transfusion.

(Choices B and E) Cystoscopy and renal ultrasound can identify a urinary tract obstruction or renal mass, which may present with ﬂank pain and dark red urine. However, these conditions do not cause hypotension or acute disseminated intravascular coagulation.

A 30-year-old man is admitted for observation following a motorcycle collision. He was hemodynamically stable at presentation, and the initial workup revealed an isolated liver laceration. The patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. He consumes 3-4 alcoholic drinks daily and has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Overnight, his hemoglobin levels acutely decreased, and a packed red blood cell transfusion was ordered. An hour after the transfusion starts, the patient develops difﬁculty breathing. The transfusion is stopped. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 86/42 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 26/min. Pulse oximetry shows 88% on room air. Lung examination reveals bilateral crackles. Skin examination is normal. Chest x-ray reveals bilateral pulmonary inﬁltrates.

Version

This patient developed respiratory distress, hypotension, and pulmonary inﬁltrates during blood transfusion, ﬁndings concerning for transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). TRALI is an uncommon but potentially fatal transfusion reaction in which neutrophils activated by a component in the transfused blood (eg, anti-leukocyte antibodies) cause damage to pulmonary microvasculature. Risk factors for TRALI include smoking, alcohol use disorder, and critical illness.

Damage to the capillary endothelium results in inﬂammatory pulmonary edema. Hypoxia and dyspnea develop within 6 hours after transfusion initiation. Tachycardia, hypotension, and fever may also be present. Chest x-ray reveals bilateral pulmonary inﬁltrates.

The patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. He consumes 3-4 alcoholic drinks daily and has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Overnight, his hemoglobin levels acutely decreased, and a packed red blood cell transfusion was ordered. An hour after the transfusion starts, the patient develops difﬁculty breathing. The transfusion is stopped. Temperature is 36.9 C (98.4 F), blood pressure is 86/42 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 26/min. Pulse oximetry shows 88% on room air. Lung examination reveals bilateral crackles. Skin examination is normal. Chest x-ray reveals bilateral pulmonary inﬁltrates. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient's respiratory distress?

Damage to the capillary endothelium results in inﬂammatory pulmonary edema. Hypoxia and dyspnea develop within 6 hours after transfusion initiation. Tachycardia, hypotension, and fever may also be present. Chest x-ray reveals bilateral pulmonary inﬁltrates. Treatment of TRALI includes immediate transfusion cessation and respiratory supportive care; most patients require ventilatory support. Some patients recover within 24-48 hours, but the mortality rate is about 50% in previously critically ill patients.

(Choice A) Anticoagulation is indicated for pulmonary embolism, which causes tachycardia and hypoxia. Bilateral pulmonary inﬁltrates would be unusual, and the temporal association with transfusion makes TRALI more likely.

• A. Anticoagulation therapy (2%)

• B. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (1%).

• C. Diuretic therapy (10%)

D. Intravenous antihistamines (20%)

(Choice B) Broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered for transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection, which most commonly occurs after platelet transfusion and presents with fever, rigors, tachycardia, and hypotension. This patient's pulmonary ﬁndings and lack of fever make this diagnosis unlikely.

E. Respiratory supportive care only (65%)

(Choice C) Diuretic therapy is the treatment for transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). Patients have respiratory distress within 6 hours after transfusion initiation; however, hypertension due to ﬂuid overload is typically present. In addition, this patient has not received a signiﬁcant amount of ﬂuid, making TACO less likely.

(Choice D) In addition to intramuscular epinephrine, intravenous antihistamine administration is indicated in anaphylactic transfusion reactions, which can present with respiratory distress and hypotension. However, anaphylaxis occurs within minutes after transfusion initiation. Moreover, examination typically reveals wheezing (not crackles), and pulmonary inﬁltrates would not be seen.

A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after she experienced several episodes of large-volume melena and maroon hematochezia over the previous 2 days. The patient was hospitalized 2 weeks ago for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute thrombosis of the right popliteal vein. She has been taking rivaroxaban since discharge.The patient is mostly sedentary due to dyspnea and deconditioning.Blood pressure is 86/62 mm Hg and pulse is 115/min and regular. Mucous membranes are pale.The abdomen is soft and nontender. Right calf circumference is increased compared to the left. Laboratory results are as follows:

This patient with recent acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding (ie, hypotension, major transfusion requirement) soon after anticoagulation was initiated. Anticoagulation therapy can unmask sources of bleeding.Given the patient's active/uncontrolled bleeding sources (small bowel angiodysplasias not accessible by endoscopy), resumption of anticoagulation would lead to potentially severe rebleeding.

However, lack of anticoagulation in this patient with recent acute DVT increases her risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). Inferior vena cava (IVC) ﬁlters trap clots in transit from the legs to the lungs. They are an option for patients with acute DVT and absolute contraindications to anticoagulation (eg, intracranial hemorrhage, active/uncontrollable bleeding source).

Endoscopy reveals numerous bleeding angiodysplasias of the gastric wall and small bowel. Only some of the lesions can be successfully coagulated. Which of the following is the best management for this patient's venous thromboembolic disease?

Although IVC ﬁlters protect against PE (relative risk ~0.5), they increase the long-term risk of recurrent DVT (relative risk ~2). Prevention of PE is considered the more pressing clinical priority, especially in this patient with decreased cardiopulmonary reserve (ie, severe chronic lung disease). Short-term complications of IVC ﬁlters include bleeding and infection at the puncture site.

(Choice A) Due to its quickly titratable and reversible kinetics, unfractionated heparin is an attractive short-term strategy for patients requiring anticoagulation who have non-lifethreatening bleeding sources that are under control and accessible for intervention in the event of rebleeding (eg, surgical site). It would not be appropriate for this patient who just experienced life-threatening hemorrhage and has ongoing, inaccessible, active bleeding.

(Choice C) Although the patient's existing popliteal DVT may spontaneously dissolve after several weeks, the clot itself is a thrombogenic nidus, tending to stimulate its own propagation. Furthermore, the risk of PE is very high (>50%) with unprotected DVT. Therefore, observation without intervention would be unsafe. The option of an IVC ﬁlter should be discussed with the

patient.

/ • B. Insertion of an inferior vena cava ﬁlter (76%)

• C. Observation with no further intervention (3%)

• D. Placement of compression stockings (7%)

• E. Substitution of aspirin for rivaroxaban (3%)

(Choice D) Compression stockings are used for post-thrombotic syndrome, which can produce pain, swelling, and lower extremity ulceration from chronic venous insufﬁciency following DVT. However, they are not effective in preventing or treating existing acute DVT. (Choice E) Aspirin is sometimes offered for secondary prevention of DVT after a patient completes a full course of anticoagulation. In contrast, aspirin monotherapy has a trivial therapeutic effect as primary treatment for acute DVT and may increase the risk of

A 74-year-old hospitalized woman is evaluated due to recurrent fever. The patient was admitted due to a perforated appendicitis with abscess. CT-guided abscess drainage was performed, and nonoperative management with bowel rest, intravenous antibiotics, and ﬂuids administered through a central venous catheter was initiated. Blood cultures from the emergency department at the time of admission were negative, but culture of the drained abscess grew mixed gram-negative rods and anaerobes.Over several days, the fever resolved and symptoms improved. However, on day 1u or nospitalization, the tever recurrea. Physical examination shows no erythema or tenderness at the central venous catheter The lungs are clear to auscultation and heart sounds are normal. There is mild lower abdominal tenderness with normal bowel sounds. Laboratory results show leukocytosis. Antibiotic coverage is broadened, and repeat blood cultures grow budding yeasts 24 hours later. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Her temperature is 39.4 C (102.7 F), blood pressure is 82/60 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination shows a swollen left thigh with moderate erythema over the left proximal thigh and buttock. The buttock and distal thigh are markedly tender to palpation, and the patient has no sensation to light touch over the proximal thigh. Blood pressure improves with intravenous ﬂuids. CT scan of the affected area is shown in the exhibit. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

• A. Abscess

B. Cellulitis

• C. Hematoma

• D. Necrotizing fasciitis

E. Pyomyositis

• F. Thrombophlebitis

G. Toxic shock syndrome

A 74-year-old hospitalized woman is evaluated due to recurrent fever. The patient was admitted due to a perforated appendicitis with abscess. CT-guided abscess drainage was performed, and nonoperative management with bowel rest, intravenous antibiotics, and ﬂuids administered through a central venous catheter was initiated. Blood cultures from the emergency department at the time of admission were negative, but culture of the drained abscess grew mixed gram-negative rods and anaerobes. Over several days, the fever resolved and symptoms improved. However, on day 10 of hospitalization, the fever recurred. Physical examination shows no erythema or tenderness at the central venous catheter site. The lungs are clear to auscultation and heart sounds are normal. There is mild lower abdominal tenderness with normal bowel sounds. Laboratory results show leukocytosis. Antibiotic coverage is broadened, and repeat blood cultures grow budding yeasts 24 hours later. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this

patient?

• A. Antifungal therapy and removal of catheter (78%)

Explanation

This hospitalized patient has budding yeasts in her blood cultures, indicating likely candidemia. Most cases are due to Candida albicans, a normal commensal of the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but a minority are caused by nosocomially acquired Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or Candida auris. Major risk factors include central venous catheters (portal of entry: skin), Gl surgery/perforation (portal: GI tract), intensive care unit stays, immunocompromise, and total parenteral nutrition.

The presence of budding yeast should never be considered a contaminant; the following

treatment is required:

• Empiric antifungals: Echinocandins (eg, micafungin) are considered ﬁrst-line, but the

infectious diseases team should be consulted for antifungal selection/duration and assistance with work-up.

B. Chest and paranasal sinus imaging (1%)

C. Repeat blood culture to rule out contamination (17%)

D. Serum galactomannan assay (1%)

• Removal of central venous catheter (when present): Source control typically requires removal of the central venous catheter because Candida produces a glycocalyx, which forms a protective, sticky bioﬁlm that prevents eradication.

• E. Urine Histoplasma antigen test (1%).

• Evaluation for metastatic infection: All patients with candidemia require ophthalmologic consultation to evaluate for endophthalmitis. Echocardiography is often required in those with persistent positive blood cultures to rule out infective endocarditis; additional imaging (eg, abdominal CT scan) may also be warranted depending on symptoms.

(Choice D) Galactomannan is a major component of the cell wall of Aspergillus, and serum assays can assist with diagnosis; because galactomannan is not a major constituent of yeast cell walls, evaluation for its presence is not helpful in candidemia. In contrast, serum beta-Dglucan level is highly sensitive (but not speciﬁc) for yeast infections.

• E. Urine Histoplasma antigen test (1%),.

(Choice E) Urine Histoplasma antigen can diagnose histoplasmosis. Although Histoplasma capsulatum exists as a yeast at body temperature, it does not divide by budding. Furthermore, it is not a common central-line or nosocomial infection.

A 40-year-old man comes to the emergency department with 2 weeks of fever, malaise, weakness, and an unintentional 2.3-kg (5-lb) weight loss. During the last 4 days, he developed left-sided chest and upper abdominal pain. He has asymptomatic mitral valve prolapse. His wife was treated for an upper respiratory infection 3 weeks ago. The patient works for a large corporation and frequently travels to Mexico. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history. He does not use alcohol. His temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 96/min, and respirations are 16/min. Lung examination shows decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung ﬁeld with dullness to percussion. Cardiac examination shows a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Laboratory results are as

• Possible splenomegaly

• Most commonly due to Staphylococcus, Streptococcus & Salmonella

• Usually diagnosed by abdominal computed tomography scan

• Combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics & splenectomy

• A. Chronic malaria (7%)

• B. Hodgkin lymphoma (13%).

C. Infectious mononucleosis (15%)

• D. Infective endocarditis (34%)

E. Lung adenocarcinoma (4%)

• F. Tuberculosis (25%)

• Possible percutaneous drainage in poor surgical candidates This patient's presentation is consistent with a likely splenic abscess, which classically causes the triad of fever, leukocytosis, and left upper-quadrant abdominal pain (due to a splenic ﬂuid collection). Patients can also develop left-sided pleuritic chest pain, left pleural effusion, and splenomegaly. Risk factors for splenic abscess include infection (eg, infective endocarditis) with hematogenous spread, immunosuppression, IV drug use, trauma, and hemoglobinopathies. Diagnosis is usually conﬁrmed by CT scan of the abdomen.

Omitted

Splenic abscess is typically due to infective endocarditis (or seeding from another site of infection). Likely mechanisms include hematogenous seeding or septic emboli to the spleen. Common causative organisms are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Salmonella. Antibiotics alone for treating splenic abscess have a high mortality (up to 50% in some studies). As a result, splenectomy is recommended for all patients. Percutaneous drainage may be an option

Patients with preexisting structural cardiac conditions are at increased risk of endocarditis. There should be strong suspicion for endocarditis in this patient who has mitral valve prolapse (associated with a ﬁvefold increased risk of endocarditis at least), fever with systemic manifestations (eg, malaise, weight loss), and splenic abscess (likely due to septic emboli); therefore, to complete the evaluation for Duke criteria, blood cultures should be obtained and echocardiography should be performed, particularly if blood culture results are positive.

A 73-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to increasing confusion for the last day. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, neuropathy, nonhealing foot ulcer, and coronary artery disease. On arrival, he is lethargic. Temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 18/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Mucous membranes are moist. Cardiopulmonary examination reveals no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Neurologic examination shows no focal ﬁndings. A nonhealing diabetic ulcer with small eschar is present over the right heel; there is no purulence, tenderness, or surrounding erythema. Laboratory results are as follows:

Sodium 140 mEq/L Potassium 4.0 mEq/L Chloride 102 mEq/L Bicarbonate 16 mEq/L Glucose 220 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient within the ﬁrst hour of arrival in the emergency department?

Explanation

This patient's confusion, hypotension, acidosis (bicarbonate of 16 mEq/L), and foot eschar raise suspicion for sepsis due to diabetic foot infection. Although sepsis is often associated with hypothermia or fever, patients with diabetes mellitus often cannot mount a signiﬁcant inﬂammatory cytokine response due to leukocyte dysregulation from hyperglycemia. Therefore, diabetic foot infections often present with no signiﬁcant local (eg, erythema, warmth, draining purulence) or systemic (eg, fever) manifestations despite limb or life threating infection.

The following early interventions reduce risk of death in patients with suspected sepsis:

• Aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation: Rapid administration of large-volume (eg, 30 mL/kg) intravenous crystalloid ﬂuids should be performed within the ﬁrst 3 hours; 500-mL boluses are typically given. Assessment for pulmonary edema (eg, worsened hypoxia) occurs between doses. Indicators of adequate response include mean arterial pressure of 60-70 mm Hg and urine output of >0.5 mL/kg/hr. As tissue perfusion improves, acidosis (eg, lactic acidosis) usually improves.

• A. CT scan of the head (20%)

B. Debridement of the foot eschar (8%)

C. Intravenous antibiotics (37%)

D. Intravenous dopamine (8%)

E. Short-acting insulin (24%)

• Broad-spectrum antibiotics within an hour: A beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, piperacillin-tazobactam), carbapenem (eg, meropenem), or fourth-generation cephalosporin (eg, cefepime) is typically administered empirically; vancomycin is often added to cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Blood cultures should be drawn before antibiotic initiation to identify the causative pathogen.

(Choice A) CT scan of the head can identify hemorrhage, tumor, or stroke. However, acidosis and hypotension indicate that tissue hypoperfusion is likely causing the confusion in this patient. Fluid resuscitation and antibiotics should be given before additional testing is performed.

(Choice D) Vasopressors are required for refractory hypotension (continued hypotension after >3 L of ﬂuid resuscitation over the ﬁrst hour). This patient has not yet received signiﬁcant ﬂuid resuscitation. Furthermore, norepinephrine, not dopamine, is the preferred vasopressor for most cases of sepsis.

• A. CT scan of the head (20%)

B. Debridement of the foot eschar (8%)

C. Intravenous antibiotics (37%)

D. Intravenous dopamine (8%)

E. Short-acting insulin (24%)

(Choice E) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can cause hypotension, confusion, and acidosis but is most often seen in type 1 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes may develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), which can cause confusion and hypotension, but signiﬁcant acidosis is less common. Both conditions are associated with much higher blood glucose levels (eg, >350-500 mg/dL in DKA, up to ~ 1,000 mg/dL in HHS) than this patient's 220 mg/dL, which does not require urgent, short-acting insulin.

Educational objective:

Patients with suspected sepsis require early, aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. They should receive rapid infusion of large volume (eg, 30 mL/kg) crystalloid ﬂuid within the ﬁrst 3 hours and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics within an hour.

A 48-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to pain in his right foot and leg. Yesterday, the patient sailed a friend's boat on the ocean and sustained a small cut to his right foot while jumping onto the dock. He stopped the bleeding using direct pressure and washed the wound with antiseptic. Last night, he awoke with throbbing pain in the right foot. The patient took ibuprofen, but the pain progressively worsened. A few hours later, he developed fever with rigors.The patient was recently diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis after laboratory studies showed abnormal liver aminotransferases and elevated transferrin saturation. He has not received treatment and has no other medical problems. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 120/min. The patient is in moderate distress. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm laceration on the dorsum of the right foot with extensive surrounding edema, erythema, and several dark-colored bullae. There is streaking erythema extending up the proximal right thigh. Leukocyte count is 21,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism of this patient's current

• Rapidly progressive (often <12 hours)

• Septicemia - septic shock, bullous lesions

• Cellulitis - hemorrhagic bullae, necrotizing fasciitis

• Blood & wound cultures

• Empiric in those with likely illness as highly fatal

• Intravenous ceftriaxone + doxycycline

• A. Pasteurella multocida (2%)

• B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21%)

• C. Staphylococcus aureus (15%)

• D. Streptococcus pyogenes (10%)

• E. Vibrio vulniﬁcus (50%)

Vibrio vulniﬁcus is a free-living, gram-negative bacterium that grows in brackish coastal water and marine environments. Levels are greatest in the summer months, reaching as high as 8% of total bacteria in some areas. Infections are primarily acquired through the consumption of raw oysters (which concentrate the bacteria) or through wound contamination during recreational activities (eg, sailing) or raw seafood handling. Most patients who become ill have liver disease (eg, alcoholic cirrhosis, viral hepatitis); those with hemochromatosis are at particularly great risk as free iron acts as an exponential growth catalyst.

A 48-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to pain in his right foot and leg. Yesterday, the patient sailed a friend's boat on the ocean and sustained a small cut to his right foot while jumping onto the dock. He stopped the bleeding using direct pressure and washed the wound with antiseptic. Last night, he awoke with throbbing pain in the right foot. The patient took ibuprofen, but the pain progressively worsened. A few hours later, he developed fever with rigors.The patient was recently diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis after laboratory studies showed abnormal liver aminotransferases and elevated transferrin saturation. He has not received treatment and has no other medical problems. He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 120/min. The patient is in moderate distress. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm laceration on the dorsum of the right foot with extensive surrounding edema, erythema, and several dark-colored bullae. There is streaking erythema extending up the proximal right thigh. Leukocyte count is 21,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism of this patient's current

condition?

recreational activities (eg, sailing) or raw seafood handling.Most patients who become ill have liver disease (eg, alcoholic cirrhosis, viral hepatitis); those with hemochromatosis are at particularly great risk as free iron acts as an exponential growth catalyst.

Patients with wound contamination typically develop a mild cellulitis, but those with liver disease or certain comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus) are at risk for necrotizing fasciitis with hemorrhagic bullous lesions and septic shock. Diagnosis is made by blood and wound cultures, but treatment (intravenous antibiotics) should not be delayed due to the high risk of death. Surgical debridement may be required, particularly in high-risk patients with serious infections.

(Choice A) Pasteurella infections are typically associated with dog or cat bites/scratches and may cause rapid-onset cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis. This patient developed a wound infection shortly after sustaining an injury while sailing, making V vulniﬁcus more likely. (Choice B) Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin infections commonly occur due to hot tub (not ocean) water, nail puncture wounds, and ear piercings. Folliculitis and cellulitis are more common than necrotizing fasciitis.

• A. Pasteurella multocida (2%)

• B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21%)

• C. Staphylococcus aureus (15%)

• D. Streptococcus pyogenes (10%)

• E. Vibrio vulniﬁcus (50%)

(Choices C and D) Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are leading causes of cellulitis and erysipelas. Although these organisms may occasionally cause necrotizing fasciitis (particularly S pyogenes), lesions typically develop over a few days (not hours). In addition, exposure to ocean water in a patient with hereditary hemochromatosis makes V vulniﬁcus more likely.

Vibrio vulniﬁcus is a free-living marine bacterium that causes food-borne illness (through oysters) and wound infections. Wound infections may be mild, but some patients develop rapid-onset, severe, necrotizing fasciitis with hemorrhagic bullous lesions and septic shock. Patients with liver disease such as cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, and hereditary hemochromatosis are at particularly high risk.

A 60-year-old man undergoes a laparotomy for intestinal obstruction secondary to postoperative adhesions from a cholecystectomy 2 years ago. His other medical problems include type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. On postoperative day 3, he complains of intense pain around his laparotomy wound. His temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 121/76 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 16/min. Examination of the wound shows abundant cloudy-gray discharge and dusky, friable subcutaneous tissue. Sensation is decreased at the wound edges. His serum glucose level is 312 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

This patient has the following signs and symptoms suggestive of necrotizing surgical site infection:

• Pain, edema, or erythema spreading beyond the surgical site

• Systemic signs such as fever, tachycardia, or hypotension

• Paresthesia or anesthesia at the edges of the wound

• Purulent, cloudy-gray discharge ("dishwater drainage")

• Subcutaneous gas or crepitus

• A. Daily dressing changes and tight glucose control (9%)

B. Parenteral antibiotics and negative-pressure wound therapy (16%)

C. Parenteral antibiotics and observation (5%)

D. Parenteral antibiotics and urgent surgical debridement (68%)

E. Topical antibiotics and observation (0%)

Necrotizing surgical site infections occur more commonly in patients with diabetes and are usually polymicrobial. These infections are considered emergencies if they involve the fascial plane and develop into necrotizing fasciitis. The most important step in management of this condition is early surgical exploration to assess the extent of the process and debride necrotic tissues. Adjunctive therapies, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, adequate hydration, and tight glycemic control, are also important but are secondary to surgical

exploration.

(Choice A) Appropriate wound dressing and tight glucose control play a key role in adequate surgical wound healing in diabetics. However, once infection is established, deﬁnitive therapy with surgical exploration and antibiotic therapy is needed.

Version

(Choice B) Negative-pressure wound therapy (ie, vacuum-assisted wound closure) is a wound-dressing system that applies sub-atmospheric pressure to a wound to accelerate the healing process. It is reserved for healthy, granulating wounds. It is not used initially when the wound is infected or necrotic.

(Choice C) Intravenous antibiotics alone are sufﬁcient therapy for wound infections limited to cellulitis, but surgical debridement is required when the infection penetrates the deeper skin layers and adjacent tissue, as in this patient.

(Choice E) Topical antimicrobial agents do not have a clear role in surgical site infections. They are not useful for prevention as they may inhibit wound healing, and they are not a substitute for parenteral therapy once infection has been established.

correct answer

• Antibiotic therapy (eg, vancomycin, cefepime, clindamycin) This patient had nasal packing and subsequently developed rapid-onset shock, a diffuse macular rash, and gastrointestinal symptoms, likely indicating toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is most often linked to growth of Staphylococcus aureus in a foreign body (eg, tampons, nasal packing) or skin/wound infection. It is caused by the release of bacterial exotoxins (eg, TSS toxin-1) that indiscriminately activate T cells, leading to a massive release of inﬂammatory cytokines.

Prompt treatment is required to prevent multiorgan failure and death. Management includes supportive therapy (eg, intravenous ﬂuids), foreign body removal, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

(Choice A) Meningococcemia most often affects young adults and frequently presents with fever, vomiting, rapid-onset shock, and rash. However, the rash is typically petechial, not macular; and most patients have severe myalgia and meningeal signs (eg, headache, nuchal rigidity). Recent nasal packing and macular rash are more consistent with TSS.

(Choice B) Rocky mountain spotted fever can cause fever, vomiting, and rash. Although the rash may be macular initially, it quickly evolves to petechiae; in addition, it begins on the extremities and moves centripetally. Furthermore, cutaneous symptoms tend to arise several days after the onset of other symptoms.

A 54-year-old man comes to the emergency department after 2 days of fever, chills, dysphagia, and drooling. The patient has been unable to eat or drink due to pain in his mouth and neck. He has a history of heavy alcohol use but does not use recreational drugs. Temperature is 38.8 C (101.8 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. The patient appears toxic with drooling and a mufﬂed voice. The tongue is displaced posteriorly and superiorly due to a swollen area on the ﬂoor of the mouth. The bilateral submandibular area is tender, indurated, and nonﬂuctuant with palpable crepitus. Which of the following is the most likely source of infection in this patient?

Explanation

Ludwig angina is a rapidly progressive cellulitis of the submandibular space. Most cases arise from dental infections in the mandibular molars that spread contiguously down the root into the submylohyoid (and then sublingual) space. The infection is usually polymicrobial with a mixture of oral aerobic (eg, viridans streptococci) and anaerobic bacteria.

A. Bloodstream (2%)

B. Epiglottis (19%)

C. Lymph nodes (5%)

D. Palatine tonsils (11%)

• E. Parotid glands (13%)

• F. Teeth roots (47%)

Patients develop symptoms rapidly with systemic (fever, chills, malaise) and local compressive (eg, mouth pain, drooling, dysphagia, mufﬂed voice, airway compromise) manifestations. Physical examination ﬁndings are often striking due to mass effect from edema. The submandibular area is usually tender and indurated, and the ﬂoor of the mouth is often elevated, displacing the tongue. Anaerobic, gas-producing bacteria may cause crepitus.

CT scan of the neck conﬁrms the diagnosis and rules out an abscess. Most patients are treated with intravenous antibiotics (eg, ampicillin-sulbactam, clindamycin) and removal of the inciting tooth. Drainage and surgery are rarely required as the process is cellulitic and typically nonsuppurative, but they may be required if there is no improvement with antibiotics. Impaired respiratory status requires prompt attention and early intervention with a mechanical

airway.

The patient has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and ascending aortic aneurysm with moderate aortic insufﬁciency. He has not been hospitalized or used antibiotics recently. The patient is an ex-smoker with a 30-pack-year history and has no drug allergies.

pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination reveals right-sided lung crackles and a soft, early diastolic murmur. Leukocytes are 14,000/mm', and a chest x-ray shows inﬁltrates in the right upper lobe of the lung. Which of the following antibiotics should be avoided in this patient to prevent complications associated with his comorbid conditions?

Explanation

This patient with fever, cough, and a pulmonary inﬁltrate on chest x-ray most likely has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). All of the antibiotics listed can play a part in the management of CAP. However, given this patient's aortic aneurysm, the use of ﬂuoroquinolones (eg, levoﬂoxacin, moxiﬂoxacin, ciproﬂoxacin) is relatively contraindicated. Fluoroquinolones upregulate cell matrix metalloproteases, leading to increased collagen degradation; this mechanism is likely responsible for several associated adverse effects, including Achilles tendon rupture, retinal detachment, and aortic aneurysm rupture.

• A. Amoxicillin (2%).

B. Azithromycin (17%)

C. Ceftriaxone (2%)

D. Doxycycline (11%)

E. Levoﬂoxacin (65%)

The increased risk of aortic aneurysm rupture with ﬂuoroquinolones is small overall, but it warrants serious consideration due to the high morbidity and mortality of rupture. Hence, when possible, these drugs should be avoided in patients with known aortic aneurysm or substantial risk factors for aortic aneurysm (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, advanced atherosclerotic disease, uncontrolled hypertension).

Other adverse effects of ﬂuoroquinolones that are likely unrelated to collagen degradation include encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and QT-interval prolongation.

(Choice B) Macrolides (eg, azithromycin, clarithromycin) are sometimes used as monotherapy for outpatient treatment of CAP when rates of resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae are low in the community; they can also be combined with a beta-lactam antibiotic for inpatient treatment. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal disturbance (eg, nausea) and QT-interval

prolongation.

(Choice C) Ceftriaxone is usually the beta-lactam of choice for inpatient treatment of CAP. Like most beta-lactams, ceftriaxone is associated with hypersensitivity reactions. It is also associated with cholestasis in some patients.

(Choice D) Doxycycline monotherapy is appropriate for outpatient treatment of CAP, and the

drug is sometimes combined with a beta-lactam for inpatient treatment. Adverse effects include skin photosensitivity and medication-induced esophagitis.

A 42-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to increasing anal pain. Three days ago, he noticed mild anal discomfort when wiping after a bowel movement; since then, the pain has steadily increased and is now constant and severe. The patient has had no anal drainage, hematochezia, or melena. Medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is no family history of colon cancer. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min.Examination shows an erythematous, tender, 2-cm mass external to the anal verge on the right. Digital rectal examination is normal, and stool guaiac testing is negative. Incision and drainage are performed under local anesthesia, yielding approximately 5 mL of purulent ﬂuid. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

This patient with a perianal abscess has undergone incision and drainage and should now receive systemic antibiotic therapy to decrease the risk of abscess recurrence and ﬁstula formation.

• A. Colonoscopy (6%)

Anorectal abscesses arise when an anal crypt gland becomes obstructed, allowing bacterial overgrowth. Initially the obstruction may cause only mild symptoms (eg, discomfort when wiping), but as bacteria and white blood cells (ie, purulent ﬂuid) collect and expand (eg, distally into the perianal skin), severe anal pain and systemic symptoms (eg, fever) may develop. On physical examination, a superﬁcial abscess usually appears as an erythematous, tender mass, often with ﬂuctuance, in the perianal skin.

Explanation

a history of end-stage kidney disease due to chronic glomerulonephritis and undergoes intermittent hemodialysis. Yesterday, after a dialysis session, she began experiencing malaise and chills. Overnight, she had high fever, chills, and rigors and became increasingly lethargic. There is no history of sore throat, cough, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The patient's other medical conditions include sigmoid diverticulosis and asymptomatic gallstones. Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F), blood pressure is 84/52 mm Hg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 20/min. There is no erythema, purulence, or tenderness at the tunneled dialysis catheter insertion site. The lungs are clear on auscultation, and heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no extremity edema or skin rash. Laboratory studies reveal neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevated lactic acid level. Blood is drawn for culture; intravenous ﬂuids and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are started via peripheral intravenous catheter. Chest x-ray shows no inﬁltrates. Which of the following additional interventions is most appropriate at this time?

Patients undergoing hemodialysis through a tunneled dialysis catheter are at high risk for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) due to migration of skin ﬂora through the catheter lumen into the bloodstream. Because tunneled dialysis catheters have a cuff that prevents bacterial migration along the exterior of the catheter, patients with CRBSI usually have no evidence of infection around the external catheter site (eg, erythema, purulence). Therefore, most cases present with systemic signs of infection (eg, fever, chills, malaise) with no localizing manifestations to a particular region of the body. Progressive signs of shock (eg, lactic acidosis, confusion, hypotension) can occur rapidly due to bacteremia.

• A. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (26%).

B. Dialysis catheter removal (56%)

C. Intravenous corticosteroids (8%)

D. Nuclear medicine bone scan (0%)

E. Right upper quadrant ultrasound (7%)

Patients with suspected CRBSI require urgent blood cultures and hemodynamic support (in the setting of hypotension or shock). Empiric antibiotic therapy (eg, vancomycin plus ceftazidime) against common skin pathogens (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulasenegative Staphylococcus) should be initiated without delay. Most patients then require prompt removal of the dialysis catheter to eliminate the nidus of infection and prevent persistent or progressive bacteremia. However, in some cases (eg, very poor access), antibiotic lock therapy may be used in lieu of dialysis catheter removal; the catheter is then exchanged over a guidewire several days later.

(Choices A and E) This patient's abdominal examination is normal, and she has no symptoms localizing to the abdomen (eg, diarrhea, abdominal pain). Therefore, abdominal CT scan and right upper quadrant ultrasound are not indicated at this time; however, if the fever persists after removal of the dialysis catheter, additional imaging might be required to evaluate for another nidus of infection (eg, liver abscess).

Two days later, blood cultures of samples taken from the triple-lumen catheter and a peripheral site grow coagulase-negative staphylococci in 4 of 4 bottles. What is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition?

CONS (eg, Staphylococcus epidermidis).Patients usually have fever and purulence/erythema around the catheter insertion site, but these manifestations are not always present. If the infection is left untreated, sepsis (eg, hypotension, tachycardia) frequently develops.

Patients with suspected CRBSI should have 2 sets of blood cultures: 1 set from a peripheral site and 1 set from the catheter. This helps differentiate contamination (eg, 1 of 4 cultures is positive) from true infection (eg, 4 of 4 cultures are positive). With CoNS, other microbiologic features that suggest infection rather than contamination include: growth in both aerobic and anaerobic bottles; and multiple blood cultures with the same organism with the exact same drug susceptibility. Empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics are typically administered until culture results return.

• A. Blood culture contamination during collection (8%)

B. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (76%)

C. Foley catheter-related urinary tract infection (9%)

(Choice C) Risk of urinary tract infection increases when Foley catheters are in place for >3 days. Although this patient's Foley catheter has likely been in place since the operation, most Foley catheter-related infections are caused by gram-negative enteric organisms such as Escherichia coli. CoNS is an atypical cause of urinary tract infection.

D. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (0%)

E. Surgical site infection (3%)

• F. Transfusion-transmitted bacteremia (1%)

(Choice D) Hospital-acquired pneumonia occurs >48 hours after admission. Although this patient has been hospitalized for 6 days, his normal pulmonary examination and respiratory rate make pneumonia unlikely. In addition, CoNS would be an atypical cause of pneumonia; most hospital-acquired pneumonias are caused by gram-negative bacilli (eg, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, E coli), Streptococcus, or S aureus.

(Choice F) Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection (eg, due to bacteria transmitted from the donor's blood or skin or from environmental contamination) can cause high fever, but most cases present within 30 minutes of transfusion, not 6 days later.

Educational objective:

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the most common cause of catheter-related bloodstream infection. Although CoNS is a frequent blood culture contaminant, bloodstream infection is likely in patients who have blood culture growth in ≥2 bottles (both aerobic and anaerobic) with the same organism and drug susceptibility.

This patient has an enlarging, symptomatic inguinal hernia and is being appropriately considered for surgical repair. Emergency repair is indicated for patients with bowel obstruction, acute incarceration, or hernia strangulation, but otherwise elective repair is usually appropriate.

Besides perioperative pulmonary complications, smoking is associated with an increased risk of surgical site infection (SSI). Smoking causes alterations in tissue perfusion, inﬂammatory response, and collagen synthesis that can promote infection and contribute to poor wound healing. Current smoking (especially smoking on the day of surgery) is associated with greater risk than past smoking, but patients who quit smoking are still at a moderately increased risk compared to those who have never smoked. Smoking cessation interventions prior to elective surgery are recommended, especially if cessation can be achieved at least 4-6 weeks before

surgery.

A 62-year-old man comes to the office due to increasing discomfort and bulging at the right

groin. He was previously diagnosed with a direct inguinal hernia but had no operative repair. The patient recently had acute bronchitis with an incessant dry cough, which caused the hernia to enlarge. He has had no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or constipation. Medical history includes hypothyroidism, seasonal allergy, and several previous episodes of sinusitis.Medications are levothyroxine and a glucocorticoid nasal spray. The patient smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and drinks alcohol occasionally. Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 24 kg/m?. Physical examination shows a nontender, easily reducible groin mass. Surgical hernia repair is planned. Which of the following most increases the risk for postoperative wound infection in this patient?

surgery.

(Choice A) Obese patients are at increased risk of SSI, especially related to abdominal procedures (eg, ventral hernia repair). Underweight patients may also be at increased risk, although this risk is more speciﬁcally attributable to malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia. This patient has a normal BMI and attributable risk is nominal.

• A. Body mass index (1%).

• B. Comorbid conditions (5%)

• C. Medications (8%)

D. Prior infections (4%)

(Choice B) Certain comorbid conditions, especially uncontrolled diabetes and peripheral arterial disease, are associated with increased risk of SSI. Hypothyroidism may blunt fever and mask signs of SSI but is not associated with a signiﬁcant increase in infection risk.

• E. Smoking history (79%)

A 26-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to right heel pain and swelling. He accidentally stepped on a rusty nail while working 2 weeks ago. The nail pierced his sneaker and entered his right heel. He applied over-the-counter antibiotic cream and took oral acetaminophen but continued to have pain. The patient has no other medical problems and takes no medications. He has no known drug allergies. He smokes 2 or 3 cigarettes daily and drinks alcohol occasionally. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respirations are 14/min. The right heel is swollen, red, warm, and tender to palpation. A small puncture wound is visible. Laboratory results show mild leukocytosis. X-ray of the right foot reveals bone changes suggestive of osteomyelitis. Which of the following is the most likely organism causing this patient's infection?

Explanation

Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are responsible for most deep

infections following puncture wounds. Pseudomonas infections are particularly prevalent after puncture wounds through the sole of a shoe as the warm, moist environment is quite hospitable to this microorganism.

• A. B-hemolytic streptococci (10%).

• B. Candida albicans (0%)

• C. Clostridium tetani (18%).

Many puncture wound injuries remain asymptomatic, but it is estimated that >50% develop superﬁcial cellulitis or deeper infections such as osteomyelitis. Evidence of an active infection is increased in those with skin ﬁndings of infection (edema, warmth, erythema, tenderness), leukocytosis, and fever. Radiographs are usually required to evaluate for underlying osteomyelitis when deep-penetrating injuries occur; however, bone changes consistent with osteomyelitis often take ≥2 weeks to form. Blood cultures are usually drawn, and bone biopsy with culture may be required to identify the microorganism. Treatment includes intravenous antibiotics (eg, ciproﬂoxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam) and surgical debridement.

D. Escherichia coli (0%)

E. Klebsiella pneumoniae (0%)

• F. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (0%).

G. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (45%)

• H. Staphylococcus epidermidis (24%)

(Choices A and H) B-hemolytic streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci may cause wound infections but rarely cause osteomyelitis in the absence of predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus.

(Choice B) Candida osteomyelitis is sometimes seen in injection drug users but is rare following a puncture wound.

A 38-year-old hospitalized man is evaluated for persistent fever. He has a history of paraplegia after spinal injury and was admitted 2 weeks ago due to septic shock from an infected sacral pressure ulcer. His condition improved with broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous ﬂuids, vasopressors, and wound debridement, but he has been having recurrent fevers for the past 4 days.The patient also has a history of asthma and takes an inhaled glucocorticoid and bronchodilator.Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 96/min.Several white patches are present on the oral mucosa. There is a peripherally inserted central venous catheter in the right arm with mild tenderness but no surrounding erythema. The sacral pressure ulcer has pink granulation tissue with a mild amount of serosanguinous ﬂuid. A chronic indwelling urinary catheter is draining yellowcolored urine. Repeat blood cultures grow budding yeasts. Which of the following is the most likely source of the organism in this patient's blood culture?

• • A. Central venous catheter (32%)

Explanation

Central venous catheters are the most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections as they create a direct pathway for colonized skin organisms to access the circulatory system. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus cause the majority of infections; however, Candida species are isolated in approximately 10% of cases.

Candida is a budding yeast that frequently colonizes the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract of humans. Active infections are rare in healthy individuals and are usually limited to superﬁcial structures (eg, vaginal candidiasis). However, patients with immunocompromise (eg, postchemotherapy) or intravascular catheter (especially in the intensive care unit setting) are at high risk for invasive disease.

• B. Contaminated sample (4%)

Candida bloodstream infections may cause fever, sepsis, and/or multiorgan failure.Diagnosis is made primarily with blood cultures (or biopsy), but serum beta-D-glucan antigen can be used as a rapid indicator of possible infection. Treatment usually requires several weeks of intravenous antifungals.

C. Indwelling urinary catheter (19%)

D. Oropharyngeal infection (41%)

E. Pressure ulcer (2%)

(Choice B) Candida in a blood culture should always prompt a search for a nidus of infection and should never be considered a contaminant.

(Choice C) Indwelling urinary catheters, especially those obstructed by a fungus ball, may occasionally cause candidemia; however, this is a far less common source of infection than an intravascular catheter.

Educational objective:

Candidemia is common in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit with intravascular catheters. Manifestations include fever, sepsis, and/or multiorgan failure. Blood cultures or biopsy are usually required for diagnosis. A positive blood culture for Candida should never be considered a contaminant.

This patient recently injured the tissue overlying his long ﬁnger metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and now has soft tissue swelling and erythema, ﬂuctuance (likely representing trapped pus), severe pain with passive joint movement, and fever. This presentation is consistent with septic arthritis of the MCP joint and requires urgent surgical irrigation and debridement.

Infections of the long and ring ﬁnger MCP joints of the dominant hand (eg, right hand) are often caused by a clenched-ﬁst punch to a human mouth ("ﬁght bite"), which patients may be hesitant to disclose. Puncture (eg, tooth) through the thin soft tissue overlying the MCP joint inoculates the joint or its surrounding tissues with bacteria. The initial puncture wound may appear minor, but enclosed bacterial proliferation underneath the extensor tendon and/or within the joint capsule can quickly lead to septic arthritis, evidenced by swelling, erythema, ﬂuctuance (or purulent drainage), and severe pain with passive range of motion.

Correct answer

All septic joints require drainage. Unlike larger joints (eg, knee), which can sometimes be drained via arthrocentesis or arthroscopy, the small MCP joints typically require open surgical irrigation and debridement. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics (eg, ampicillin/sulbactam) are started intraoperatively after obtaining joint cultures, and the wound is left open to drain and heal by secondary intention.

Answered correctly

Time Spent

(Choice A) Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections are commonly used to reduce inﬂammation due to arthritis. This patient's fever, recent MCP joint trauma, and clinical ﬁndings of erythema, swelling, and pain on passive joint movement are more consistent with septic arthritis (ie, joint infection), for which suppression of the immune inﬂammatory response (ie, steroids) is contraindicated.

2023

Version

(Choices B and C) Although this patient should receive antibiotic therapy (eg, empiric IV antibiotics followed by culture-directed oral antibiotics) and pain control (eg, nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs), urgent surgical intervention (vs outpatient follow-up) is required to drain the infected MCP joint and reduce the risk of permanent joint damage.

Educational objective:

Puncture of the thin soft tissue overlying the hand metacarpophalangeal joints (eg, clenchedﬁst punch to the human mouth) can result in septic arthritis, presenting with joint pain,

erythema, swelling, ﬂuctuance, and painful range of motion. Treatment requires urgent surgical irrigation and debridement and antibiotic therapy.

A 42-year-old woman is evaluated in the hospital burn unit due to confusion and a change in the appearance of her wounds. Ten days ago, she was hospitalized after sustaining inhalational injury and severe burns to 30% of her total body surface area in a house ﬁre. She has undergone staged excision and grafting of all appropriate areas and is now receiving daily dressing changes. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 114/min. The patient is alert to person and place but not time.

Physical examination shows necrosis and sloughing of skin grafts to the chest that were previously viable and adherent, with erythema of the surrounding skin. Blood cultures are drawn. Which of the following is the most appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy for this

patient's condition?

Explanation

This patient with severe burn injuries now has necrosis and sloughing of previously viable skin grafts, concerning for burn wound infection (BWI).

Burn wounds are quickly colonized with bacteria following the initial injury. Colonization typically does not impair wound healing; however, BWI does. Wound infection is deﬁned as a bacterial count of > 105 bacteria/gram of tissue on wound biopsy. Clinically, infection should be suspected when there is a change in wound appearance, loss of a viable skin graft, or development of infectious features (eg, erythema) in noninjured surrounding tissue.

BWis are categorized into invasive versus noninvasive infections as follows:

• A. Amphotericin B (0%)

B. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone (7%)

C. Cefazolin and metronidazole (8%)

D. Ciproﬂoxacin and metronidazole (11%)

E. Meropenem and vancomycin (72%)

Omitted

• Invasive wound infections have systemic manifestations (eg, confusion, tachycardia) of infection and, on biopsy, show microbial invasion into unburned tissue. Suspected invasive infection (as in this patient) requires treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics that include coverage against the 2 most common burn infection pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. First-line therapy uses a combination of either piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem (eg, meropenem), which have a broad spectrum of activity including against gram-negatives (eg, Pseudomonas), and vancomycin, which has excellent activity against methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

(Choice D) Ciproﬂoxacin and metronidazole, which are commonly used to treat colonic conditions (eg, acute diverticulitis), provide good coverage against aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. However, they provide minimal or no coverage against common gram-positive skin organisms (eg, S aureus).

Educational objective:

When invasive infection is suspected in patients with severe burn injuries, empiric antibiotic therapy is required, typically with coverage against both gram-positive skin ﬂora (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem, in combination with vancomycin, are common ﬁrst-line therapy.

A 55-year-old man undergoes a conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) for suspected pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas.Prior to the procedure, the patient receives a dose of prophylactic antibiotics. Toward the end of the operation, he is given 2 units of packed red blood cells. The patient is then extubated and transferred to the postanesthesia care unit for recovery. One hour later, he develops fever and chills. Temperature is 38.5 C (101.3 F), blood pressure is 130/76 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient is mildly sedated but responds to commands appropriately. Examination shows a mildly tender abdominal wound without erythema. There is serosanguinous discharge from the pancreatic suction drain. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A Foley catheter and right subclavian central venous access are present, both placed at the time of surgery. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's fever?

• Blood products

This patient developed fever within hours of receiving blood products; therefore, the most likely

cause is a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction. During blood storage, leukocytes

release cytokines that when transfused can cause transient fevers, chills, and malaise (without hemolysis) within 1-6 hours of transfusion. Management includes transfusion cessation (to rule out other serious causes of fever) and antipyretics.

• A. Catheter-associated infection (4%)

• B. Drug fever from antibiotic (8%)

C. Malignant hyperthermia (4%)

• D. Pulmonary embolism (0%).

• E. Surgical site infection (4%)

(Choices A and D) Acute fever (within the ﬁrst week after surgery) is often caused by nosocomial infections (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infection) or noninfectious etiologies such as pulmonary embolus (PE). The risk of infection due to indwelling urinary and central venous catheters increases with the duration of catheterization and does not typically occur in the immediate postoperative period. PE may occur within days to weeks after surgery but usually presents in conjunction with pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, and/or respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, hypoxia).

(Choices B and E) Subacute fever (>1 week after surgery) is typically due to drug fever or surgical site infection. Drug fever from antibiotics (commonly beta-lactams) is a diagnosis of exclusion and is often accompanied by rash and peripheral eosinophilia. Although a minority of surgical site infections can cause fever in the immediate postoperative period (eg, group A Streptococcus), these are fulminant infections causing pain, erythema, and edema. This patient's mildly tender wound without erythema is normal.

(Choice C) Malignant hyperthermia (usually caused by inhaled anesthetics) presents with high fever (>40 C [104 F]), muscle rigidity, and hemodynamic instability in the immediate intra- or postoperative period. This patient has normal vital signs and no muscle rigidity, making this diagnosis unlikely.

Educational objective:

Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions occur within 1-6 hours of transfusion initiation and can present in the immediate (within a few hours) postoperative period in patients who receive blood products intraoperatively.Other causes of immediate postoperative fever include prior infection or trauma, inﬂammation due to surgery, malignant hyperthermia, and anesthetic medications.

A 48-year-old woman comes to the hospital for elective cholecystectomy to treat symptomatic cholelithiasis. She has had increasingly severe, intermittent biliary colic pain, and ultrasonography revealed several gallstones. The patient has a history of hypertension and obesity. Preoperative medical evaluation and laboratory testing were unremarkable. The patient receives cefazolin for surgical site infection prophylaxis, and surgery is performed under general anesthesia. A Foley catheter is placed preoperatively. The planned laparoscopic procedure is converted to open approach due to difﬁcult anatomy; otherwise, the surgery is uneventful with minimal blood loss. Two hours later, the patient is noted to have a temperature of 38.9 C (102 F). Her blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 18/min. The patient is awake and alert but reports mild pain at the surgical site. A right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter, which was placed in the operating room, is in a good position with no redness at the insertion site. The lungs are clear on auscultation, and heart sounds are normal. The surgical site is clean with minimal serosanguinous discharge. There is no lower extremity edema. Current laboratory results are as follows:

Acute (1-7 days postoperatively) and subacute (7-28 days postoperatively) fever is usually caused by bacterial infection. Fever is delayed with infection because several days of bacterial replication are generally necessary to produce enough endotoxin/exotoxin to generate fever. Most acute postoperative fevers are caused by nosocomial infections such as urinary tract infection and pneumonia (Choice D), whereas subacute postoperative fevers are often due to abscess or infection of a central line or surgical site (Choices A and C).

(Choice B) Postoperative atelectasis is not generally considered an independent cause of fever but can predispose patients to developing pneumonia. Atelectasis is usually managed/prevented with incentive spirometry, not positive airway pressure and chest physiotherapy (these measures are primarily reserved for those with excessive secretions that lead to respiratory plugging).

(Choice E) Malignant hyperthermia is a rare cause of immediate postoperative fever. It is triggered by exposure to volatile anesthetics/succinylcholine and generally presents intraoperatively with severe muscle rigidity, hypercarbia, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Urgent treatment with dantrolene (a skeletal muscle relaxant) and cooling measures is required to prevent death.

A 35-year-old man is evaluated in the hospital burn unit due to abdominal distension and intolerance of enteral feedings. The patient was admitted 6 days ago after an electrical ﬂash injury that caused burns to 40% of his total body surface area. He has undergone 2 of 3 planned surgeries for burn excision and grafting and remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He was doing well with enteral feedings until the past 24 hours, when he developed high gastric residual volumes and progressive abdominal distension. Temperature is 39.1 C (102.4 F). Blood pressure is 112/60 mm Hg and pulse is 110/min. Oxygen saturation is 97% on minimal ventilator settings, including a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO) of 35%. On examination, all surgical dressings are clean and dry. Heart and lung sounds are normal. The abdomen is distended, soft, and tympanitic to percussion. Bowel sounds are decreased. Which of the following is the best next step in management of

this patient?

• A. Blood cultures and empiric antibiotic therapy (35%)

Explanation

Although this burn patient is being evaluated due to an apparent gastrointestinal issue (abdominal distension, intolerance to enteral feeds), several features of his presentation are concerning for possible infection, including burn wound sepsis, the leading cause of mortality in patients with severe burn injuries. In such patients, early diagnosis of burn wound sepsis is often challenging because clinical signs may be nonspeciﬁc and often overlap with those of the post-burn hypermetabolic response. Careful attention must be given to the following ﬁndings heralding the onset of burn wound sepsis, several of which are seen in this patient:

• Temperature <36.5 C (97.7 F) or >39 C (102.2 F)

• Vital sign changes, including progressive tachycardia (>90/min) or tachypnea

(>30/min), or refractory hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg)

• Evolving laboratory abnormalities (eg, leukocytosis or leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)

• B. Flexible sigmoidoscopy (6%)

• C. Immediate exploratory laparotomy (31%)

• D. Measurement of bladder pressure (9%)

• E. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (17%)

• Evidence of organ hypoperfusion and/or dysfunction, such as oliguria or new-onset enteral feeding intolerance (eg, high gastric residual volumes) after a period of tolerance, which may reﬂect splanchnic hypoperfusion leading to gastrointestinal hypomotility and ileus (distended, tympanitic abdomen; decreased bowel sounds)

(Choice B) Flexible sigmoidoscopy can be diagnostic and therapeutic for sigmoid volvulus, a potential cause of abdominal distension and food intolerance. However, sigmoid volvulus classically evolves over several days (vs 1 day), occurs in elderly patients, and does not cause fever unless perforation and peritonitis (eg, with abdominal rigidity) are present.

(Choice C) Although this patient has abdominal distension, there are no signs of peritonitis (eg, rigidity) on examination; therefore, exploratory laparotomy is not immediately indicated and further workup (eg, cultures, imaging) can be performed.

Correct answer

Answered correctly

(Choice D) Bladder pressure measurement can estimate intraabdominal pressure when abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) (ie, intraabdominal hypertension causing organ dysfunction) is suspected. ACS presents as abdominal distension, and trauma and burns are risk factors for ACS. However, patients typically have a tense abdomen (vs this patient's soft abdomen) and, if intubated, usually require increasing ventilator support to oppose increased abdominal pressure on the diaphragm (vs this patient's minimal ventilatory settings).

(Choice E) Upper gastrointestinal obstruction (which endoscopy can detect) can cause high gastric residuals but is unlikely to cause generalized abdominal distension (ie, if little passes through the stomach). This patient's distended, tympanitic abdomen and decreased bowel sounds are more consistent with ileus (eg, from sepsis-induced splanchnic hypoperfusion).

Educational objective:

Patients with severe burn injuries are at high risk for sepsis. Acute enteral feeding intolerance may be an early sign of sepsis, indicating end-organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction.

The spleen has an important role in immune surveillance. Splenic dendritic cells identify antigens in the blood and present them to helper T lymphocytes, which then stimulate B lymphocytes to differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Splenic function is particularly important in control of encapsulated pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae. Without the spleen, patients have an insufﬁcient antibody response to these organisms and are at risk for rapid-onset fulminant infection.

Therefore, patients age >19 who require splenectomy should receive the following vaccines to ensure adequate immunity against the most common encapsulated pathogens:

• Pneumococcus: Patients should receive the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20). Alternately, patients may be given the 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15) followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) at least 8 weeks later (Choice E).

The tetanus-reduced diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) and hepatitis vaccines (both A and B) should be given according to standard guidelines for the general population. Recombinant zoster vaccination is not required for young adults (age <50) who undergo splenectomy; risk of reactivation with varicella-zoster virus (shingles) is not increased because the immune response against viral pathogens is primarily cytotoxic T-cell (not antibody) mediated (Choices

A and D).

All patients undergoing splenectomy should receive vaccines either ≥14 days before or ≥14 days after the procedure. Although antibody titers are comparable if vaccines are given within 14 days of splenectomy, the functional activity of the antibodies is lower in these patients than in those receiving the vaccines 14 days later.

Educational objective:

Following splenectomy, patients are at increased risk for rapid-onset fulminant infection due to encapsulated organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae. Vaccinations against these organisms should be administered either ≥14 days before scheduled splenectomy or ≥14 days after splenectomy.

Explanation

malaise, fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and pain in the right upper abdomen. Two months ago, the patient was diagnosed with unresectable adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas. He refused chemotherapy, and a palliative biliary stent was placed. Temperature is 38.4 C (101.1 F), blood pressure is 110/64 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the right lung base and guarding and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory results are

as follows:

This patient with unresectable pancreatic cancer who recently had palliative biliary stenting (eg, to relieve biliary obstruction due to the cancer) now has fever, leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. This presentation is most concerning for a

pyogenic liver abscess, which can result from direct spread from the biliary tract (eg, infected biliary stent) or hematogenous spread through the portal vein (eg, intraabdominal infection) or systemic circulation (eg, endocarditis).

• Enzyme immunoassay for C difﬁcile toxins and glutamate dehydrogenase antigen (a protein present on all C difﬁcile strains): These tests are not as sensitive as PCR; however, stool toxin testing is more speciﬁc than PCR for active infection because it detects active toxin production.

When symptoms of active CDI are present (ie, infection rather than colonization is already suspected), the more sensitive PCR test is typically preferred.

(Choice A) Blood cultures are indicated in a patient with new-onset fever due to suspected bacteremia. However, given this patient's classic symptoms (eg, profuse watery diarrhea) and risk factors (eg, recent antibiotics), empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics should not be given because they can worsen CDI. Bacteremia is uncommon in CDI.

A 54-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after sustaining severe burns

Explanation

from a deep fryer explosion that occurred when she attempted to deep fry a frozen turkey. Temperature is 36 C (96.8 F). Blood pressure is 102/64 mm Hg and pulse is 110/min. The patient is alert but in severe pain. Examination reveals partial- to full-thickness burns of the face, neck, anterior chest and abdomen, and all 4 extremities. Intravenous access is obtained, and crystalloid resuscitation is administered, along with analgesia. The patient is brought to the burn unit, where her wounds are cleansed and dressed using topical antimicrobial ointment. During the subsequent treatment of this patient's burn injuries, which of the following is most likely to decrease the patient's risk for developing infection?

Patients with severe burn injuries have multiple risk factors for wound infection and sepsis, including disruption of the skin's protective barrier, burn-induced immunosuppression, and the presence of necrotic tissue (ie, burn eschar), which serves as an avascular, protein-rich substrate for bacterial and fungal proliferation. To control the level of bacterial colonization on burned areas, topical antimicrobial agents are typically applied during regular dressing changes. However, most topical agents cannot penetrate eschar, resulting in the eschar serving as a potential nidus for infection.

A. Early initiation of total parenteral nutrition (15%)

Removal of eschar through early (eg, within 5 days of injury) wound excision and grafting reduces the risk of both noninvasive and invasive burn wound infections.

• B. Early wound excision and grafting (46%)

• C. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (8%)

• D. Prophylactic IV antibiotic therapy (26%)

• E. Wound compression therapy (3%)

• In the operating room, layers of devitalized tissue are progressively removed until capillary bleeding is encountered (ie, tangential excision).

(Choice A) Early nutritional support can offset hypermetabolism and improve overall outcomes in patients with severe burn injuries. However, parenteral (ie, intravenous) nutrition is typically avoided because it is associated with higher rates of infection and mortality compared to enteral (eg, via feeding tube) nutrition.

(Choice C) Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the plasma partial pressure of oxygen and is sometimes used to treat chronic, ischemic wounds (eg, diabetic foot ulcers) or as an adjuvant treatment for severe soft tissue infections (eg, necrotizing fasciitis). However, increased plasma oxygen levels cannot penetrate burn eschar because it is devascularized. Therefore, eschar removal is a better next step for both infection prevention (ie, source control) and promotion of wound healing.

This patient's fever, leg pain, and MRI ﬁndings are concerning for osteomyelitis. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk for osteomyelitis because impaired blood ﬂow of sickled cells through narrow metaphyseal vessels causes microinfarctions that act as a nidus for infection. In addition, splenic infarctions render patients with SCD functionally asplenic and therefore more susceptible to infection with encapsulated organisms.

Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella are the most common causes of osteomyelitis in children with SCD. Although S aureus is the predominant pathogen in patients without SCD, Salmonella is an encapsulated gram-negative organism that accounts for a large proportion of osteomyelitis in children with SCD.

A 50-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 2 days of malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal discomfort, and bloody stools. The patient had end-stage renal disease and underwent kidney transplantation 4 months ago. He had no major postoperative issues and currently takes mycophenolate, tacrolimus, and prednisone. The patient has a 15 pack-year smoking history but quit several years ago.Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical examination shows mild abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Rectal examination is normal. Stool is guaiac positive. Laboratory results are as follows:

Explanation

Patients who undergo renal transplantation receive high-dose immunosuppressant medication for several months after surgery, putting them at risk for opportunistic infections. One of the most common opportunistic infections following renal transplantation is cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a widely prevalent herpesvirus that establishes a latent infection after initial inoculation. Most patients remain asymptomatic, but infection may reemerge in patients who are severely immunocompromised.

CMV reactivation results in viremia and/or tissue-invasive disease. The gastrointestinal tract is the most common organ system affected, and patients usually manifest symptoms of colitis or enteritis, including fever, malaise, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory studies often show cytopenias due to bone marrow involvement, and peripheral blood smear typically reveals atypical lymphocytes.

A 50-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to 2 days of malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal discomfort, and bloody stools. The patient had end-stage renal disease and underwent kidney transplantation 4 months ago. He had no major postoperative issues and currently takes mycophenolate, tacrolimus, and prednisone. The patient has a 15 pack-year smoking history but quit several years ago.Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical examination shows mild abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Rectal examination is normal. Stool is guaiac positive. Laboratory results are as follows:

CMV reactivation results in viremia and/or tissue-invasive disease. The gastrointestinal tract is the most common organ system affected, and patients usually manifest symptoms of colitis or enteritis, including fever, malaise, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory studies often show cytopenias due to bone marrow involvement, and peripheral blood smear typically reveals atypical lymphocytes.

Explanation

A 38-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce due to fatty food intolerance. On examination, her vital signs are normal, and she has mild right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. An ultrasonogram of the abdomen reveals multiple gallstones with no evidence of cholecystitis and an ill-deﬁned intrahepatic cyst with a thick wall. A CT of the abdomen is performed and reveals a well-deﬁned cyst with eggshell calciﬁcation. Past medical history is insigniﬁcant. She is not taking any drugs and has never had surgery. The patient has not travelled outside the United States.She has had 2 pet dogs at home for 10 years. Her parents emigrated from Peru many years ago. What is the most likely etiology for the intrahepatic cyst in this patient?

This patient has a hydatid cyst due to Echinococcus granulosus. Humans contract the Intection trom close ana Inumale contact wii dogs, which are tne deniniuve nost in tne tapeworm's lifecycle. E granulosus typically causes unilocular cystic lesions that can occur in any organ (eg, liver, lung, muscle, bone); smaller daughter cysts may be present. Multiple lesions are usually associated with E multilocularis (rather than E granulosus) infection.

A. Amebic liver abscess (7%)

B. Cysticercosis (9%)

C. Hydatid cyst (66%)

D. Pyogenic liver abscess (1%)

E. Simple hepatic cyst (15%)

Most hydatid cysts are diagnosed incidentally when patients are being evaluated for other problems (eg, fatty food intolerance likely from cholelithiasis in this patient). However, these cysts can cause symptoms due to compression on surrounding tissues. Imaging techniques and serologic testing can be used for diagnosis. "Eggshell" calciﬁcation of a hepatic cyst on CT scan is highly suggestive of a hydatid cyst.Treatment is generally surgical resection under the cover of albendazole. In some situations, aspiration can be performed, although there is a risk of anaphylactic shock due to cyst content spillage.

(Choice A) Patients with amebic liver abscess (most common extraintestinal manifestation of amebiasis) usually have fever and right upper quadrant pain that can develop within weeks of intestinal amebiasis. Eggshell calciﬁcations on CT scan would be unusual.

(Choice B) Cysticercosis is due to infection with Taenia solium and generally presents as cysts in the brain or muscle.

lime soent

(Choice D) Pyogenic liver abscesses generally develop following surgery, gastrointestinal infection, or acute appendicitis. Patients typically have extreme pain, high fevers, and leukocytosis.

Version

(Choice E) Simple hepatic cysts are believed to be congenital. The pathophysiology is related to ﬂuid secretion by the epithelial lining. Patients with simple hepatic cysts that cause symptoms usually report dull right upper quadrant pain, abdominal bloating, or early satiety. However, these cysts will not show calciﬁcation on CT scan.

Educational objective:

In humans, hepatic hydatid cysts are due to infection with Echinococcus granulosus. Dogs are the deﬁnitive host. A cystic hepatic lesion with eggshell calciﬁcation is highly suggestive of infection with this organism.

A 38-year-old woman comes to the emergency department complaining of severe pain and swelling in her left leg. She fell 2 days ago while playing recreation-league soccer and suffered a mildly painful abrasion to her posterior left thigh. The pain has worsened steadily since and is now unbearable. Initially only her left proximal thigh was painful and red, but now the pain has spread to her buttock and proximal calf. The patient also complains of fatigue and chills. Her temperature is 39.4 C (102.7 F), blood pressure is 82/60 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination shows a swollen left thigh with moderate erythema over the left proximal thigh and buttock.

• Systemic symptoms (eg, fever, hypotension) Treatment • Requires surgical débridement & broad-spectrum antibiotics This patient has fever, hypotension, erythema, and swelling. Notably, she has pain out of proportion to the physical examination ﬁndings. In addition, her CT scan is suggestive of air in the deep tissue. This constellation of ﬁndings is concerning for necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly spreading infection involving the subcutaneous fascia, generally following trauma. It can also result from signiﬁcant peripheral vascular disease (ie, diabetes). Group A streptococci is the most frequently recovered pathogen, although necrotizing fasciitis is usually polymicrobial. Gas production by microbes leads to air in the soft tissues, which results in crepitus on examination in about 50% of cases.

Patients with necrotizing fasciitis have pain and swelling of the affected site. The pain is frequently more severe than expected based on the degree of swelling and erythema and usually precedes systemic signs such as fever or hypotension. Untreated necrotizing fasciitis progresses to rapid discoloration of the affected site, purulent discharge, bullae, and necrosis.

frequently more severe than expected based on the degree of swelling and erythema and usually precedes systemic signs such as fever or hypotension.Untreated necrotizing fasciitis progresses to rapid discoloration of the affected site, purulent discharge, bullae, and necrosis. Imaging can reveal the extent of the infection and identify air in the tissue bed. However, if necrotizing fasciitis is strongly suspected, therapy should not be delayed to pursue additional imaging. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and resection of necrotic tissue are necessary for treatment. Because of its rapid progression, necrotizing fasciitis causes signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality even with aggressive treatment.

(Choice A) Skin and soft-tissue infections that are successfully limited by the immune system and tissue barriers present as abscesses. Abscesses are localized to a tender, ﬂuctuant area and do not spread aggressively as does necrotizing fasciitis. Systemic signs such as hypotension and high fever are unusual.

(Choice B) Cellulitis is an acute skin infection that presents with warmth, erythema, edema, and tenderness. Evidence of underlying tissue necrosis, including severe pain or crepitus or systemic signs such as hypotension, should raise concern for a more aggressive process such as necrotizing fasciitis or other deep-tissue infection.

(Choice C) Deep-muscle hematomas can occur with moderate to severe trauma.Deep hematomas that arise with minor trauma are not commonly seen except in patients with bleeding disorders.

©UWorld This patient who sustained blunt abdominal trauma during a motor vehicle collision now has abdominal pain, left upper quadrant tenderness, and intraperitoneal free ﬂuid on Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) examination. This presentation is concerning for intraabdominal hemorrhage, possibly from splenic injury.

Management of suspected intraabdominal hemorrhage (eg, positive FAST) depends on the patient's hemodynamic status:

• Hemodynamically unstable (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) patients should undergo emergency exploratory laparotomy because hemodynamic instability implies rapid, ongoing hemorrhage that may be fatal without immediate surgical intervention

(Choice C).

A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a motor vehicle collision.The accident occurred 1 hour ago when his vehicle spun out of control and rolled over. He was wearing his seatbelt and his airbag deployed. The patient is alert and reports abdominal pain. Blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 106/min, and respirations are 16/min. On examination, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally and the chest wall is nontender. Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is nondistended with tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. There are no gross deformities of the extremities. A Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) examination reveals free ﬂuid in the left subphrenic space. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

• • A. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis (54%)

• Hemodynamically stable patients, such as this one, can likely tolerate a trip to the CT scanner without clinical deterioration. These patients should undergo further imaging (eg, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast) to visualize the site of injury and determine whether there is ongoing bleeding (seen as contrast extravasation).

Some injuries that cause hemoperitoneum (eg, some splenic and hepatic lacerations) can be managed nonoperatively with angiography and arterial embolization or, if prior bleeding has stopped, close observation (eg, serial hematocrits and abdominal examinations).

• B. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (1%)

• C. Exploratory laparotomy (41%)

• D. No additional workup (0%)

• E. Serial abdominal examinations (1%)

(Choice B) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is used at the bedside to rapidly evaluate hemodynamically unstable patients with equivocal FAST results for intraabdominal hemorrhage (which would require immediate laparotomy). This patient is hemodynamically stable and can tolerate undergoing CT scan to better visualize his intraabdominal injuries and determine whether nonoperative management (eg, embolization) is possible.

(Choice D) A positive FAST exam in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma usually indicates intrabdominal hemorrhage (although visualized ﬂuid can also be ascites or urine). To visualize the source of the ﬂuid, determine the extent of injury, and guide further management, further workup (eg, CT scan) is necessary. Visualizing ongoing bleeding is critical because it may require intervention (eg, surgery, embolization).

(Choice E) Serial abdominal examinations are useful in hemodynamically stable patients with a negative FAST exam and low suspicion for intraabdominal injury (eg, minimal abdominal pain, benign abdominal examination). However, this patient has a positive FAST exam, so further imaging (eg, CT scan) is indicated.

Educational objective:

Patients with blunt abdominal trauma and suspected intraabdominal hemorrhage (eg, free intraperitoneal ﬂuid) on Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma examination are managed according to their hemodynamic status. Hemodynamically stable patients can tolerate further imaging and should undergo contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.

A 22-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a persistent, painful erection he has had for the past 6 hours. The patient has had similar episodes that lasted 1-2 hours but resolved spontaneously. He says his symptoms started this morning without provocation when he woke up. The patient recently started a summer job working outside pouring concrete. Medical history includes sickle cell disease; he has not taken any medications other than his usual folic acid. The patient does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. On examination, the penis is rigid, and the glans is soft. The scrotum is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Explanation

Priapism in sickle cell disease

• Sickling of blood in corpora cavernosa

• Increased viscosity & decreased venous outﬂow

• B. A. Administer Administer a an packed intravenous red blood beta cell blocker transfusion (7%) (12%)

• Physical factors: fever, cold, dehydration

Triggers

• Drugs/medications: cocaine, alcohol, testosterone

• Aspiration of blood from corpora cavernosa

Treatment

C. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin (10%)

D. Aspirate blood from the corpora cavernosa (66%)

• E. Insert a urinary catheter (3%)

• Intracavernous injection of phenylephrine This patient with sickle cell disease has priapism, a persistent, painful erection in the absence of ongoing sexual stimulation. Penile erections are normally terminated by sympathetic activation, which constricts arterial ﬂow to the corpora cavernosa; blood subsequently exits the corpora via the emissary veins, leading to detumescence. However, in priapism, abnormal autonomic or vascular tone or obstruction of venous outﬂow can lead to a prolonged erection.

Time Spent

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of priapism due to altered blood viscosity and resulting venous obstruction. Priapism in SCD can be precipitated by fever, cold exposure, alcohol, medications, dehydration (the likely trigger in this case), or cocaine use. Patients with SCD commonly experience brief, spontaneously terminating priapism events (ie, stuttering priapism) leading up to a more severe event that requires medical care.

Priapism is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to avoid long-term complications (eg, erectile dysfunction). Initial management of priapism includes aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa. Blood gas analysis of aspirated blood typically shows an ischemic pattern with acidosis, hypoxemia, and hypercarbia.

A 22-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a persistent, painful erection he

has had for the past 6 hours. The patient has had similar episodes that lasted 1-2 hours but resolved spontaneously. He says his symptoms started this morning without provocation when he woke up. The patient recently started a summer job working outside pouring concrete. Medical history includes sickle cell disease; he has not taken any medications other than his usual folic acid. The patient does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. On examination, the penis is rigid, and the glans is soft. The scrotum is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

fever, cold exposure, alcohol, medications, dehydration (the likely trigger in this case), or cocaine use. Patients with SCD commonly experience brief, spontaneously terminating priapism events (ie, stuttering priapism) leading up to a more severe event that requires medical care.

Priapism is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to avoid long-term complications (eg, erectile dysfunction). Initial management of priapism includes aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa. Blood gas analysis of aspirated blood typically shows an ischemic pattern with acidosis, hypoxemia, and hypercarbia. In addition to aspiration, additional treatment may include intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic drug (eg, phenylephrine) to stimulate contraction of cavernous smooth muscle and facilitate venous emptying.

C. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin (10%)

D. Aspirate blood from the corpora cavernosa (66%)

(Choice A) Blood transfusion is generally performed in SCD with uncomplicated severe anemia; in case of complicated anemia (eg, acute chest syndrome), exchange transfusion may be performed. Packed red blood cell transfusion is typically not beneﬁcial in priapism caused by SCD and would not be the ﬁrst step in management.

• E. Insert a urinary catheter (3%).

(Choices B and C) Detumescence occurs because sympathetic nervous system input causes cavernous smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction (not vasodilation) of the blood vessels in the penis. Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator, and beta blockers have little effect on penile vascular tone; neither has a role in the treatment of priapism.

(Choice E) Insertion of a urinary catheter is necessary only if a patient with priapism is unable to void. It does not treat the underlying pathology.

Educational objective:

Priapism is a persistent, painful erection in the absence of ongoing sexual stimulation. Sickle cell disease is associated with an increased risk of priapism due to altered blood viscosity and resulting venous obstruction. Initial management of priapism includes aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa, often followed by intracavernous injection of phenylephrine.

Acute-onset scrotal pain and edema occurring after trauma has a broad differential diagnosis (eg, scrotal contusions, hematoma, testicular rupture). However, testicular torsion is an underrecognized diagnosis that can occur after testicular trauma and should be considered in any patient with signiﬁcant scrotal pain and swelling. Although the diagnosis of testicular torsion is often made clinically, a Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum is the imaging of choice to evaluate scrotal contents and can conﬁrm torsion in those without a clear diagnosis or evaluate other causes of scrotal pain. Ultrasound ﬁndings of reduced or absent blood ﬂow or twisting of the spermatic cord are suggestive of torsion.

Testicular torsion occurs due to insufﬁcient attachment of the testicle to the tunica vaginalis, allowing for testicular hypermobility; mild trauma or exercise can induce twisting of the testis on the spermatic cord, leading to testicular ischemia. Spontaneous torsion can also occur. Other classic ﬁndings of torsion include absent cremasteric reﬂex (elevation of the testicle with stroking of the inner thigh) and scrotal pain unrelieved by elevation of the testicle (negative Prehn sign), although this test cannot reliably rule out torsion. Testicular torsion is a surgical emeraencv: up to 80% of patients with untreated torsion develop a nonviable testicle within 12

A varicocele is a tortuous dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins surrounding the spermatic cord and testis. It occurs in nearly 20% of men (usually between age 15-25) and presents as a soft, irregular mass ("bag of worms") that increases in size with standing and Valsalva. Reduction on supine positioning (due to decompression of the plexus) can also be seen. Varicoceles are more common on the left side because the left spermatic vein drains to the left renal vein, which is vulnerable to compression where it passes between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. Bilateral varicoceles are also common; however, unilateral right varicoceles are relatively rare and should raise suspicion for thrombosis or malignant compression.

The diagnosis of varicocele can be conﬁrmed on ultrasound, which shows dilation of the pampiniform plexus and retrograde venous ﬂow. Initial interventions for scrotal discomfort due to a varicocele include scrotal support and simple analgesics (eg, nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory druas).

A 16-year-old boy comes to the ofﬁce due to occasional discomfort and heaviness of his scrotum over the past several months. He has had no trauma, dysuria, or urethral discharge. The patient is not sexually active. He is afebrile, and vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, an irregular, ropy mass is noted on both sides of the upper scrotum. The mass increases in size with Valsalva and reduces on supine positioning. There is no erythema, ulcers, or tenderness of the scrotal skin and no inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination is normal. Surgical correction is discussed with the patient and his parents. The primary reason to perform surgery is to prevent which of the following complications in this patient?

Varicoceles are associated with increased risk for infertility and testicular atrophy, which may be due to slightly increased scrotal temperature. For older men who do not have concerns about fertility, no intervention may be needed. However, younger men should be followed for signs of testicular atrophy or changes in semen analysis; abnormal ﬁndings generally warrant surgical intervention. When intervention is indicated, surgical venous ligation can improve fertility.

(Choice A) Chronic epididymitis is usually a noninfectious inﬂammatory process, and is believed in most cases to be related to retrograde ﬂow of urine into the epididymis. It carries an independent risk of infertility, but it is not a complication of varicocele.

A. Chronic epididymitis (1%)

B. Infertility (60%)

C. Intestinal strangulation (22%)

D. Scrotal skin ulceration (1%)

(Choice C) Intestinal strangulation is a potential complication of inguinal hernia, which can cause a bulge in the groin and extend into the scrotum but would not have a "bag of worms" (ropy) texture and is less likely to reduce in supine position.

• E. Testicular cancer (4%)

• F. Torsion of the testis (10%)

(Choices D and F) A hydrocele is a ﬂuid collection within the tunica vaginalis; it typically presents in newborns as a painless scrotal swelling, although it is occasionally seen in adult men. On rare occasions, large hydroceles can cause irritation and ulceration in the overlying skin. In addition, congenital hydroceles are associated with an increased risk for testicular torsion due to inadequate ﬁxation of the lower pole of the testis to the tunica vaginalis. This patient's irregular scrotal mass that changes in size with position is more consistent with varicocele.

This patient's solid, hard, nontender testicular mass raises strong suspicion for testicular cancer, the most common solid-organ malignancy in men age 15-35. Most cases present with a unilateral testicular nodule that is generally painless but may be associated with a dull ache in the lower abdomen or perineum. Subsequent bimanual examination of the testes usually reveals a hard, ovoid mass within the tunica albuginea.

Prompt diagnostic workup and treatment is required to provide the best chance for cure. This generally includes:

• Scrotal ultrasound, which usually reveals a solid, hypochoic lesion (seminoma) or a

lesion with cystic areas and calciﬁcations (nonseminomatous germ cell tumor [NSGCT]). • Serum tumor markers such as B-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein, and lactate dehydrogenase, which are often elevated (particularly with NSGCTs).

• Radical inguinal orchiectomy, which is performed to conﬁrm the diagnosis

This adolescent male has recurrent abdominal pain and nausea after strenuous physical activity; examination reveals a normal abdomen but a tender, erythematous scrotum. This presentation suggests testicular torsion, which occurs due to insufﬁcient ﬁxation of the testis to the tunica vaginalis, allowing testicular hypermobility. Exercise, mild trauma, or movement during sleep can induce twisting of the testis about the spermatic cord, leading to obstruction of blood ﬂow and testicular ischemia.

Testicular torsion occurs most commonly in adolescents due to enlargement of the testes during puberty. Classically, patients experience severe, acute-onset scrotal pain that does not resolve with elevation of the testicle (negative Prehn sign); however, some patients report inguinal or lower abdominal pain as their primary symptom. Nausea and vomiting are common. Prior episodes that resolve without intervention (as in this patient) can indicate

intermittent torsion.

He experienced no trauma to the abdomen and has had no fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. The patient has had similar episodes over the past s weeks Tollowing lacrosse maicnes, but these episodes resolved shortly afterward with rest. He has no history of groin or scrotal swelling.The patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. He is sexually active with 1 partner and uses condoms inconsistently. Temperature is 37.7 C (99.9 F). The abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended. There is scrotal erythema and edema; the right hemiscrotum is tender to palpation. The pain is worsened when the scrotum is elevated, and the scrotum does not transilluminate. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Physical examination classically reveals a tender, high-riding testicle; a horizontal lie of the testis may be visible. The scrotum is typically erythematous and markedly swollen. The cremasteric reﬂex (stroking the inner thigh causing testicular elevation) is characteristically absent. The diagnosis is often made clinically, but a Doppler ultrasound can be used for conﬁrmation. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency and should prompt urgent urologic evaluation for detorsion because loss of testicular viability can occur within a matter of hours.

(Choice A) Acute epididymitis can cause similar symptoms in a sexually active patient; however, pain (which initially affects the posterior testis, where the epididymis is located) is unlikely to occur intermittently and is typically improved with elevation of the testis (positive Prehn sign). Dysuria and urethral discharge may also be present.

• A. Epididymitis (16%)

• B. Incarcerated inguinal hernia (15%).

C. Infected hydrocele (1%)

• D. Testicular hematoma (3%).

• E. Testicular rupture (0%)

(Choice B) Incarcerated inguinal hernia can cause scrotal pain and swelling, but patients typically have a history of a mass that increases with elevated intraabdominal pressure (eg, bearing down). Pain that worsens with testicular elevation makes torsion more likely than inguinal hernia. In addition, an incarcerated hernia would not usually occur intermittently and resolve without intervention.

• F. Testicular torsion (63%)

(Choice C) Infected hydrocele is very rare but could present with lower abdominal or scrotal pain; however, infection would more likely cause progressive pain and fevers as opposed to the intermittent, recurrent symptoms this patient has experienced.

A 34-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to erectile dysfunction. For the past 2 months, he has had pain and penile curvature during erections, which has made vaginal penetration difﬁcult and has started to adversely affect his self-esteem. The patient has had no urethral discharge or other symptoms. He smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. The patient has had a total of 5 female sexual partners. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender with no masses. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy. A palpable plaque is present on the dorsal side of the penis approximately half way between the glans and the pubis. The testes are normal with no scrotal erythema or skin ulceration. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Explanation

This patient's dorsal penile plaque and pain/curvature with erection likely indicate Peyronie disease (PD), a common condition (affecting ~5% of men) that arises due to repetitive blunt trauma to the penis during sexual intercourse with subsequent aberrant wound healing. It is characterized by the formation of ﬁbrous plaques (due to transforming growth factor-1 upregulation) in the tunica albuginea, which reduce tissue elasticity and expansion during erections.

• A. Genital warts (3%)

B. Penile cancer (6%)

C. Peyronie disease (88%)

D. Systemic sclerosis (0%)

Manifestations generally include penile pain, curvature, and dorsal nodules or plaques. Distortion of the penis during erection may make sexual intercourse difﬁcult or impossible, leading to body image and relationship issues. Most cases are diagnosed based on clinical ﬁndings, but ultrasound is sometimes necessary. In many individuals, the pain and deformity resolve spontaneously over 1-2 years.

Peyronie disease is an acquired disorder characterized by ﬁbrosis of the tunica albuginea of the penis, which restricts tissue expansion and ﬂexibility during erections. Manifestations often include penile pain, curvature, and/or dorsal nodules/plaques; distortion of the normal erectile shape of the penis may make sexual intercourse difﬁcult.

A 30-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to 3 days of dysuria and urinary frequency. He had similar symptoms twice over the past 4 months; both times, he was told he had a urinary tract infection and had complete resolution of symptoms following short courses of antibiotic therapy. He is sexually active and has pain with ejaculation but no urethral discharge or fever. The patient smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. He has no other chronic medical issues. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 78/min. Abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness. External genitalia are normal without any focal tenderness, rashes, or ulcerations. Rectal examination reveals a smooth, nontender prostate. Urinalysis is as follows:

• A. Chronic bacterial prostatitis (32%)

Explanation

Chronic bacterial prostatitis

• Young & middle-aged men

Epidemiology

• † Risk with diabetes, smoking, urinary tract procedure

• Coliforms enter from urethra via intraprostatic reﬂux

Pathogens

• Escherichia coli causes >75% of cases

• Recurrent urinary tract infection (with the same organism)

• +/- Prostatic tenderness & swelling (often absent)

Presentation

• Pain with ejaculation

• History of antibiotic treatment → transient improvement

• Pyuria and bacteriuria on urinalysis

Diagnosis Treatment

• Bacteria in prostatic ﬂuid > bacteria in urine

• Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciproﬂoxacin) for 6 weeks This patient's recurrent symptoms of urinary tract infection, pain with ejaculation, and pyuria/bacteriuria raise strong suspicion for chronic bacterial prostatitis. Most cases arise in young or middle-aged men who smoke or have diabetes mellitus. Coliform bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli) cause the majority of cases and generally gain access to the prostate from the urethra via the intraprostatic reﬂux of urine.

Manifestations are often subtle, but many patients have 21 of the following:

• Symptoms of recurrent urinary tract infections (eg, dysuria, frequency, suprapubic tenderness, pyuria, bacteriuria) that transiently improve with short courses of antibiotic

The diagnosis is generally made clinically, but conﬁrmation requires prostatic massage followed by examination of prostatic ﬂuid (prostatic ﬂuid bacteria > urine bacteria prior to prostatic massage). Eradication of the pathogen usually requires at least 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy (eg, ﬂuoroquinolone).

(Choice B) Chronic epididymitis is usually caused by infectious (eg, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis) or autoimmune conditions. Chronic infectious epididymitis can lead to painful ejaculation and a small amount of pyuria. However, focal tenderness over the epididymis (posterior testis) would be expected; in addition, bacteriuria and transient improvement with antibiotics (as seen in this patient) make chronic epididymitis unlikely.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?

/ A. Chronic bacterial prostatitis (32%)

(Choice C) Chronic urethritis is primarily due to insufﬁcient treatment of N gonorrhoeae or C trachomatis or the presence of an atypical sexually transmitted organism (eg, Trichomonas vaginalis). The lack of urethral discharge makes this diagnosis less likely.

• B. Chronic infectious epididymitis (25%)

• C. Chronic infectious urethritis (29%)

• D. Chronic pyelonephritis (2%).

(Choice D) Chronic pyelonephritis can cause recurrent lower urinary tract symptoms (eg, dysuria, pyuria, bacteriuria) but most patients have fever, ﬂank pain, and costovertebral tenderness. Furthermore, painful ejaculation would be uncommon. Most cases of chronic pyelonephritis occur with structural abnormalities in the urinary tract (eg, ureteral obstruction, struvite stones).

E. Interstitial cystitis (9%)

(Choice E) Interstitial cystitis occurs mostly in women and usually causes suprapubic pain that worsens with bladder ﬁlling and improves with voiding.Patients sometimes have lower urinary tract symptoms (eg, urgency, frequency) and hematuria, but pain on ejaculation, pyuria, and bacteriuria indicate an alternate diagnosis.

A 59-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to lower abdominal pain. The

Explanation

patient has had 2 days of fever, chills, dysuria, and pelvic pain; this morning, he was unable to pass any urine. He has never had similar symptoms before and has no history of chronic urinary or bowel issues. Medical history is signiﬁcant for hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease. Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 98/min. Suprapubic fullness and tenderness are present. Digital rectal examination shows an edematous and exquisitely tender prostate. The external genitalia are normal. A suprapubic catheter is placed, which drains 800 mL of urine. Laboratory examination reveals the following:

This patient's fever, dysuria, leukocytosis, and tender, swollen prostate indicate acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP). In ABP, prostatic swelling can sometimes impinge the urethra and cause difﬁculty voiding or acute urinary retention (with renal insufﬁciency). A suprapubic catheter is generally required for decompression because passage of urethral catheters can lead to sepsis (dislodging of bacteria from infected prostate) or prostatic rupture.

Most cases of ABP are caused by colonic pathogens (eg, Escherichia coli, Proteus species) that have contaminated the urethra and subsequently enter the prostate via intraprostatic urinary reﬂux. Urine culture helps deﬁne the underlying organism, but prolonged treatment (~6 weeks) with a ﬂuoroquinolone (eg, levoﬂoxacin) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is generally required to ensure eradication. These agents have excellent coverage against enteric pathogens and achieve high prostatic tissue levels.

(Choices A and C) Azithromycin and doxycycline treat genitourinary infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis, which commonly causes acute urethritis (eg, dysuria, urethral discharge) and epididymitis (eg, posterior testicular pain and swelling). However, azithromycin and doxycycline have limited activity against common enteric pathogens (eg, Escherichia coli), so they are not typically used for empiric treatment of ABP.

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

(Choice B) Clindamycin is effective against a number of gram-positive organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) and anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides) but these pathogens are less common causes of ABP.

• A. Azithromycin (3%)

• B. Clindamycin (5%).

• C. Doxycycline (5%)

/• D. Levoﬂoxacin (64%)

• E. Nitrofurantoin (20%)

(Choice E) Although nitrofurantoin provides excellent coverage for coliform organisms and is often used for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women, this medication does not achieve good prostatic tissue concentration and should not be used for ABP.

Educational objective:

Acute bacterial prostatitis is characterized by fever, dysuria, and a swollen, tender prostate. Most cases are caused by coliform organisms (eg, Escherichia coli) that have contaminated the urethra and entered the prostate via intraprostatic urinary reﬂux. Urine culture is required to deﬁne the underlying pathogen, but 6 weeks of therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a ﬂuoroquinolone is generally required to ensure eradication.

Leydig cells are the primary source of testicular testosterone but are also capable of generating estrogen. Therefore, Leydig cell tumors often present with endocrine manifestations due to excessive estrogen (eg, gynecomastia, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction) or testosterone (eg, acne, hirsutism). Examination frequently reveals a testicular mass, which is typically conﬁrmed by bilateral scrotal ultrasound. In contrast to many germ cell tumors, Leydig cells do not generally produce serum tumor markers such as B-hCG or alphafetoprotein (AFP). However, the generation of estrogen or testosterone often leads to FSH and LH suppression.

(Choice E) Pelvic ﬂoor muscle dysfunction may present with frequent urination, straining to urinate, and nocturia. However, it is much more prevalent in women, and additional symptoms (eg, constipation, difﬁculty eliminating stool) may be present. Because this dysfunction is caused by impaired relaxation of pelvic muscles, anal sphincter tone is often increased.

Educational objective:

Transurethral resection of the prostate is an effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, this procedure does not preclude the prostate tissue from growing back and causing bladder outlet obstruction.Other common complications of this procedure are urinary incontinence and urethral stricture.

Pathogenesis • Increased cavernosal pressure • Ischemia, hypoxia, acidosis

• Autonomic dysfunction: spinal cord injury

Causes/

Treatment

• Altered blood viscosity: sickle cell disease, blood dyscrasias

D. Monospot test (3%)

• Intracorporal alpha-1 adrenergic agonist (eg, phenylephrine)

• E. MRI of the spine (7%)

• F. Serum ferritin level (12%)

Priapism is a prolonged, painful erection in the absence of ongoing sexual stimulation. In an erection, parasympathetic activation induces dilation of the cavernous arteries, increasing blood ﬂow into the corpora cavernosa; this compresses the emissary veins against the tunica albuginea, blocking the outﬂow of blood. Subsequent sympathetic stimulation normally constricts arterial inﬂow and induces cavernosal smooth muscle contraction, leading to detumescence. However, persistent inﬂow or obstructed outﬂow can lead to priapism.

Most cases of priapism are idiopathic. However, priapism can be seen in hematologic disorders that cause altered blood viscosity or local microthrombi, leading to decreased outﬂow through the emissary veins. Common disorders include sickle cell disease, hematologic malignancies (eg, chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML]), thalassemia, and multiple myeloma. Priapism can also be caused by conditions (eg, spinal cord injury) or medications/drugs (eg, sildenaﬁl, trazodone, cocaine) that cause abnormal autonomic or

vascular tone.

(Choice A) This patient has no cardiopulmonary signs or symptoms to indicate a chest x-ray. Chest imaging has low utility in identifying the cause of priapism.

(Choice C) Treatment of priapism with intracorporal phenylephrine can cause hypertension and reﬂex bradycardia; some experts advise electrocardiographic monitoring during treatment for patients with comorbid heart disease, but electrocardiography is not needed for routine evaluation.

D. Monospot test (3%)

(Choice D) Infectious mononucleosis can cause hepatosplenomegaly but not altered blood viscosity or priapism. Also, this patient has no other features of mononucleosis (eg, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy).

(Choice E) Spinal cord disorders (eg, traumatic injury, spinal metastasis) can cause priapism due to disruption of autonomic innervation. However, this rarely occurs as an isolated ﬁnding; most patients have additional neurologic abnormalities (eg, urine retention, spinal shock).

• E. MRI of the spine (7%)

• F. Serum ferritin level (12%)

(Choice F) Iron studies (eg, serum ferritin level) are indicated in the evaluation of hereditary hemochromatosis. This condition can cause central (secondary) hypogonadism, leading to erectile dysfunction but not priapism.

This patient's fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, leukocytosis, and urinalysis ﬁndings of bacteriuria, pyuria, and hematuria (due to urinary tract inﬂammation) are consistent with acute pyelonephritis. Urinary tract infections (eg, pyelonephritis) are uncommon in men due to the distance between the anus and urethral opening, the length of the male urethra, and the antibacterial substances in prostatic ﬂuid. However, risk is elevated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) because periurethral prostatic enlargement impinges the urethra and prevents complete evacuation of the bladder; this allows fecal ﬂora that have contaminated the urinary tract to proliferate rather than be evacuated with urination. Bacterial ascent to the kidneys can lead to unilateral (or less commonly bilateral) pyelonephritis.

As seen in this patient, BPH usually presents with manifestations of gradual urethral impingement, including:

• Voiding symptoms (slow stream, split stream, hesitancy, straining)

• Incomplete bladder emptying (eg, elevated postvoid residual volumes) with bladder storage symptoms (eg, frequency, nocturia, urgency).

This patient's pulmonary crackles on examination are likely due to pulmonary ﬁbrosis rather than prostatic or infectious issues.

(Choice A) Detrusor overactivity can cause urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and incontinence. However, voiding symptoms (eg, decreased force of stream, dribbling) and recurrent urinary tract infections are atypical because outlet obstruction does not occur. (Choice C) Urethritis is most commonly caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Symptoms generally include dysuria and urethral discharge; ﬂank pain and costovertebral tenderness would not be seen.

(Choice D) Selective IgA deﬁciency can be associated with respiratory tract (eg, sinusitis, pneumonia) and gastrointestinal (eg, giardiasis) infections but the risk of urinary tract infection is not generally increased. This patient's lung crackles are consistent with pulmonary ﬁbrosis and do not indicate a respiratory infection.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's current condition?

(Choice E) Staghorn calculi are caused by urease-producing organisms (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella) and are usually present with ﬂank pain and hematuria. Escherichia coli is not a urease-producing organism. Furthermore, the presence of voiding symptoms makes underlying BPH with elevated post-void residuals the most likely inciting factor.

Educational objective:

• A. Detrusor overactivity (2%)

A 34-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to severe, sudden-onset pain in his penis.During sexual intercourse 2 hours ago, he heard a cracking sound followed by pain and rapid loss of erection. When attempting to urinate, the pain is aggravated, and the patient is unable to pass urine. Physical examination shows a swollen and ecchymotic penis. Following adequate analgesia, which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

• A. Cold compresses, pressure dressings, and penile splinting (17%)

Diagnosis of PF is usually clinical, and urgent surgical repair of the tunica albuginea is the mainstay of treatment. However, because concomitant urethral injury occurs in approximately 20% of PF cases (due to the close proximity of the corpus spongiosum), the following ﬁndings warrant investigation with retrograde urethrography (or urethroscopy) prior to surgery:

• Blood at the meatus

• Hematuria

• Dysuria

• Urinary retention

B. Color Doppler ultrasonography (18%)

• C. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (2%).

• D. Placement of a suprapubic catheter (22%)

If urethral injury is conﬁrmed by urethrography, then the urethra should also undergo repair at the time of surgery.

(Choice B) Color Doppler ultrasonography is sometimes used in the evaluation of testicular torsion, which would present with sudden-onset testicular pain and a high-riding testis on examination (due to ﬁxation of the testis to the tunica vaginalis).

(Choice C) CT scan is recommended in the evaluation of patients with blunt genitourinary trauma who have suspected renal injury, which would be unlikely with PF.

(Choice D) In some cases of urethral injury (typically posterior urethral injuries associated with pelvic fracture), a suprapubic catheter is required to decompress the bladder until the urethra can be repaired. However, PF causes isolated anterior urethral injury that is more commonly managed with urgent urethral repair and intraoperative urethral catheter placement (for bladder drainage as well as postoperative protection of the repair).

Educational objective:

Penile fracture is most commonly caused by blunt trauma (eg, sexual intercourse) to an erect penis. Although penile fracture is a urologic emergency that requires urgent operative repair, patients with evidence of urethral injury (eg, blood at the meatus, dysuria, urinary retention) should undergo retrograde urethrography prior to surgery.

A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a burn injury. The patient is a cook and spilled hot oil on his trunk and legs 30 minutes ago. He has no signiﬁcant medical history. Temperature is 36.2 C (97.2 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 20/min. On physical examination, the patient appears distressed and in pain. Partial- to full-thickness burns cover approximately 25% of the body surface area, including the lower abdomen, genitalia, and lower extremities.Intravenous ﬂuids are begun after access is obtained with 2 large-bore peripheral catheters. Which of the following is the best immediate step in management of this patient?

Explanation

• A. B. Ice Endotracheal application to intubation injured (10%) areas (2%)

C. Sharp surgical debridement (14%)

• D. Topical antibiotic application (12%)

The ﬁrst priorities of burn management are stabilization (eg, airway, breathing, circulation) and resuscitation (eg, intravenous ﬂuids). Extensive burns can rapidly lead to hypovolemic shock due to a large release of proinﬂammatory mediators that increase vascular permeability and lead to third spacing of ﬂuid. For this reason, patients with major burns (ie, >20% total body surface area [TBSA]) receive aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation, which is usually begun based on a formula (eg, Parkland formula) and then titrated to maintain adequate urine output (goal: ≥0.5 mL/kg/hr), a marker of organ perfusion. For accurate monitoring of urine output in these patients, a urethral catheter (eg, Foley catheter) is required.

In patients who have genital burns and other burns covering a large TBSA, a catheter should be placed as soon as possible; delay can lead to edema that obstructs visualization and catheterization of the urethra. In addition to facilitating measurement of urine output, the urinary catheter also ensures urinary continence so that urine does not soil burned areas or

(Choice A) Endotracheal intubation may be appropriate for patients with signs of smoke inhalation injury (eg, hoarse voice, singed nasal hair, carbonaceous sputum). Inhalational injury is unlikely in this patient who has none of these signs and who spilled hot oil directly onto his trunk, perineum, and legs.

(Choice B) Cool, saline-soaked gauze is sometimes applied to burned tissues within the ﬁrst few hours after injury to decrease pain. However, ice application is discouraged because it can further injure (eg, frostbite) the burned tissues and/or cause systemic hypothermia.

(Choice C) Sharp surgical debridement and skin grafting will likely be required for this patient's full-thickness burns. However, these surgical procedures are not performed until after approximately 72 hours, when burns have fully demarcated; partial-thickness burns at presentation may progress to become full-thickness over that time.

This patient with posterior testicular pain and swelling likely has acute epididymitis. Most cases arise when pathogens from the urethra travel in a retrograde fashion through the ejaculatory duct to the ductus deferens and epididymis. The likely underlying pathogen differs based on the age of the patient:

• Age <35: Most cases are caused by sexually transmitted infections, particularly

Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. Patients often have minimal urinary symptoms (eg, dysuria, frequency, urethral discharge) and mild or no pyuria.

• Age >35: Most cases are associated with bladder outlet obstruction (eg, benign prostatic

hypertrophy) and are caused by coliform bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli). Patients generally have urinary symptoms and significant pyuria (eg. >25 leukocytes/hpf) on urinalysis.

Epididymitis is often suspected when physical examination reveals posterior testicular swelling and tenderness that improves with elevation of the testes (Prehn sign). Conﬁrmation requires urinalysis/urine culture and nucleic acid ampliﬁcation testing for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis. Treatment with ceftriaxone plus doxycycline (for N gonorrhoeae or C

An 18-year-old man comes to the ofﬁce due to 3 days of progressive left testicular pain. The pain began gradually and is dull and achy. The patient has had no trauma to that area and has never had similar symptoms. He has no fever, chills, urinary frequency, dysuria, urethral discharge, or penile ulcerations. The patient is sexually active. Vital signs are normal. The left testicle is lower in the scrotum than the right. The area posterior to the left testis is swollen and very tender. The pain improves with elevation of the testis, and the cremasteric reﬂex is normal. Urinalysis shows 4-5 white blood cells/hpf.

Epididymitis is often suspected when physical examination reveals posterior testicular swelling and tenderness that improves with elevation of the testes (Prehn sign). Conﬁrmation requires urinalysis/urine culture and nucleic acid ampliﬁcation testing for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis. Treatment with ceftriaxone plus doxycycline (for N gonorrhoeae or C trachomatis) or levoﬂoxacin alone (for enteric pathogens) is generally curative. Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs and testicular elevation may provide symptomatic relief but must be accompanied by antibiotic therapy (Choice A).

(Choice C) Urgent surgery is required for testicular torsion, which is usually characterized by severe testicular pain and a negative cremasteric reﬂex (ie, testes do not elevate with stroking of inner thigh). Most cases improve with detorsion and do not require orchiectomy. In addition, this patient's progressive pain over days, posterior testicular tenderness, and normal cremasteric reﬂex make torsion unlikely.

(Choice D) Incision and drainage is occasionally required to treat hydrocele, a collection of ﬂuid between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis; hydrocele is generally marked by painless testicular swelling over weeks or months. Incision and drainage may also be required for a testicular abscess, which is usually marked by a ﬂuctuant ﬂuid collection; pain from an abscess is unlikely to improve with elevation of the testes.

version

(Choice E) Renal and bladder ultrasound can identify urinary tract obstruction (eg, hydroureter) or certain renal pathologies (eg, cysts, neoplasm). It does not adequately visualize testicular conditions.

Educational objective:

Acute epididymitis is associated with posterior testicular pain/swelling, improvement of pain with testicular elevation, and normal cremasteric reﬂex. Most cases are caused by sexually transmitted pathogens (eg, Chlamydia, Neisseria) in patients age <35 and by colonic

pathogens (eg, Escherichia coli) in those age >35. Treatment with antibiotics is required.

This condition occurs due to insufﬁcient ﬁxation of the testis to the tunica vaginalis, which can lead to testicular hypermobility, twisting of the spermatic cord, ischemia, and necrosis.

Although testicular torsion occurs most commonly in adolescent boys (due to rapid testicular growth during puberty), it can present in any age group. Patients typically develop acute-onset, severe scrotal pain, often after physical activity or mild testicular trauma; associated nausea and vomiting are common. Boys classically awaken at night due to pain, and some patients report prior episodes that resolved without intervention (intermittent torsion).

Physical examination classically reveals a profoundly tender, enlarged, high-riding testicle associated with marked scrotal swelling and erythema. The cremasteric reﬂex (elevation of the ipsilateral testicle when the inner thigh is stroked) is absent. The diagnosis is often made clinically. However, Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum can be used for conﬁrmation or in

Temperature is 37.7 C (99.9 F), blood pressure is 142/90 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination shows marked swelling, induration, and erythema of the right hemiscrotum. Ultrasound reveals that the right testicle is twice as large as the left. The right testicle is heterogeneous in echotexture and has a small hydrocele. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?

Physical examination classically reveals a profoundly tender, enlarged, high-riding testicle associated with marked scrotal swelling and erythema. The cremasteric reﬂex (elevation of the ipsilateral testicle when the inner thigh is stroked) is absent. The diagnosis is often made clinically. However, Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum can be used for conﬁrmation or in case of equivocal ﬁndings. It may demonstrate twisting of the spermatic cord or reduced blood ﬂow, and a reactive hydrocele may be present. Heterogeneous echotexture, as seen in this patient, is a late ﬁnding indicating testicular necrosis, which develops after > 12 hours of ischemia and can result in nonviability. Therefore, if testicular torsion is suspected, urgent urologic evaluation is indicated.

(Choice A) Although inguinal hernias can cause a scrotal mass and present after elevated intraabdominal pressure (eg, weight lifting), pain is typically localized to the groin or abdomen rather than the scrotum, the testicles remain normal sized, and ultrasound demonstrates loops of bowel within the scrotum.

• A. Bowel protrusion through weakened fascia (23%)

B. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus (4%)

(Choice B) Varicocele is characterized by dilation of the pampiniform plexus within the spermatic cord. Examination ﬁndings are often described as a "bag of worms" in the scrotum. Varicocele is often asymptomatic but may cause a dull pain that worsens with standing.

C. Malignant neoplasm of the testis (2%)

D. Persistent patent processus vaginalis (20%)

(Choice C) Testicular neoplasms typically present subacutely as a painless, slow-growing testicular mass. Acute pain and swelling are more consistent with testicular torsion.

(Choice D) Hydrocele is a collection of peritoneal ﬂuid within the scrotum that forms due to a patent processus vaginalis; reactive hydrocele can occur in the setting of testicular trauma. While hydroceles cause scrotal swelling, they do not cause testicular enlargement and typically cause mild, dull pain rather than the acute, severe pain noted in this patient.

©UWorld This patient who sustained blunt abdominal trauma during a motor vehicle collision now has abdominal pain, left upper quadrant tenderness, and intraperitoneal free ﬂuid on Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) examination. This presentation is concerning for intraabdominal hemorrhage, possibly from splenic injury.

Management of suspected intraabdominal hemorrhage (eg, positive FAST) depends on the patient's hemodynamic status:

• Hemodynamically unstable (eg, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) patients should undergo emergency exploratory laparotomy because hemodynamic instability implies rapid, ongoing hemorrhage that may be fatal without immediate surgical intervention (Choice C).

(Choice C).

A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a motor

vehicle collision.The accident occurred 1 hour ago when his vehicle spun out of control and rolled over. He was wearing his seatbelt and his airbag deployed. The patient is alert and reports abdominal pain. Blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 106/min, and respirations are 16/min. On examination, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally and the chest wall is nontender. Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is nondistended with tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. There are no gross deformities of the extremities.

• • A. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis (54%)

• Hemodynamically stable patients, such as this one, can likely tolerate a trip to the CT scanner without clinical deterioration. These patients should undergo further imaging (eg, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast) to visualize the site of injury and determine whether there is ongoing bleeding (seen as contrast extravasation).

Some injuries that cause hemoperitoneum (eg, some splenic and hepatic lacerations) can be managed nonoperatively with angiography and arterial embolization or, if prior bleeding has stopped, close observation (eg, serial hematocrits and abdominal examinations).

• B. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (1%)

• C. Exploratory laparotomy (41%)

• D. No additional workup (0%)

• E. Serial abdominal examinations (1%)

(Choice B) Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is used at the bedside to rapidly evaluate hemodynamically unstable patients with equivocal FAST results for intraabdominal hemorrhage (which would require immediate laparotomy). This patient is hemodynamically stable and can tolerate undergoing CT scan to better visualize his intraabdominal injuries and determine whether nonoperative management (eg, embolization) is possible.

(Choice D) A positive FAST exam in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma usually indicates intrabdominal hemorrhage (although visualized ﬂuid can also be ascites or urine). To visualize the source of the ﬂuid, determine the extent of injury, and guide further management, further workup (eg, CT scan) is necessary. Visualizing ongoing bleeding is critical because it may require intervention (eg, surgery, embolization).

(Choice E) Serial abdominal examinations are useful in hemodynamically stable patients with a negative FAST exam and low suspicion for intraabdominal injury (eg, minimal abdominal pain, benign abdominal examination). However, this patient has a positive FAST exam, so further imaging (eg, CT scan) is indicated.

Educational objective:

Patients with blunt abdominal trauma and suspected intraabdominal hemorrhage (eg, free intraperitoneal ﬂuid) on Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma examination are managed according to their hemodynamic status. Hemodynamically stable patients can tolerate further imaging and should undergo contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.

A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 40 weeks gestation is hospitalized for induction of labor. She has no chronic medical conditions, and her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Intravaginal misoprostol is administered for cervical ripening followed by intravenous infusion of oxytocin. Progressive uterine contractions are achieved, and the fetal heart rate tracing is reassuring. Patient-controlled bupivacaine via an epidural catheter is started for pain control. Twenty minutes later, the patient experiences perioral numbness, a metallic taste in her mouth, and tinnitus. She also reports feelings of anxiety and palpitations but has no headache or visual disturbances. Blood pressure is 150/86 mm Hg and pulse is 110/min. Physical examination reveals normal deep tendon reﬂexes and no clonus. While being examined, the patient has a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's seizure?

•• A. Bupivacaine systemic toxicity (61%)

Explanation

During labor, epidural analgesia is the preferred method of pain control because it provides pain relief with minimal maternal and fetal sedation. The epidural catheter is normally inserted into the epidural space to deliver a controlled, low-concentration, slow release of local anesthetic (eg, bupivacaine).

However, the epidural catheter can sometimes be inadvertently inserted into the epidural vasculature, resulting in direct delivery of the anesthetic into the maternal circulation and rapid systemic drug absorption. This causes local anesthetic systemic toxicity, which initially blocks inhibitory neural pathways to cause symptoms of CNS overactivity (eg, perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus). This CNS overactivity may develop into a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Cardiovascular sympathetic activation (eg, tachycardia, hypertension) can follow with a risk of fulminant cardiovascular collapse.

• B. Eclampsia (17%)

• C. Inadvertent spinal block (6%).

• D. Misoprostol adverse effect (1%)

• E. Oxytocin toxicity (12%)

Management of local anesthetic systemic toxicity is with drug cessation, benzodiazepines for seizure control, and supportive care.

(Choice B) Eclampsia is a common cause of intrapartum seizure and can present with hypertension. In contrast to this patient, those with eclampsia typically have headache, visual disturbances (eg, scotomata), and hyperreﬂexia with clonus.

(Choice C) An inadvertent spinal block can occur if the epidural catheter accidentally punctures the dura and local anesthetic is injected into the intrathecal space. This can cause a "high spinal" or total spinal anesthesia, a life-threatening complication that typically presents with hypotension and respiratory depression due to diaphragmatic paralysis.

Version

(Choice D) Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin, is more commonly associated with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which are not seen in this patient. It is not associated with

seizures.

(Choice E) Oxytocin has a similar structure to antidiuretic hormone and can cause severe hyponatremia, cerebral edema, and seizures if administration is excessive or prolonged (eg, lengthy induction of labor). However, oxytocin toxicity does not typically cause perioral numbness or a metallic taste.

A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 40 weeks gestation is hospitalized for induction of labor. She has no chronic medical conditions, and her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Intravaginal misoprostol is administered for cervical ripening followed by intravenous infusion of oxytocin. Progressive uterine contractions are achieved, and the fetal heart rate tracing is reassuring. Patient-controlled bupivacaine via an epidural catheter is started for pain control. Twenty minutes later, the patient experiences perioral numbness, a metallic taste in her mouth, and tinnitus. She also reports feelings of anxiety and palpitations but has no headache or visual disturbances. Blood pressure is 150/86 mm Hg and pulse is 110/min. Physical examination reveals normal deep tendon reﬂexes and no clonus. While being examined, the patient has a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's seizure?

A 68-year-old man is evaluated in the cardiac care unit for confusion and agitation 3 days

Explanation

after coronary artery bypass grafting. Other than blood transfusion for perioperative bleeding, the surgery was uncomplicated. After initial difﬁculty weaning, the patient was successfully extubated on postoperative day 2. His pain has been well controlled with IV morphine, and he was calm throughout the day. This evening, the patient suddenly became anxious and started to pull his IV catheter. Medical history is signiﬁcant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and peripheral artery disease. He does not drink alcohol. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 138/86 mm Hg, pulse is regular at 96/min, and respirations are 18/min. Pulse oximetry is 96% on room air. The patient is oriented to person but not place or time. During examination, he tries to grab the bed rails and sit up but calms down easily with reorientation. The patient states that he is frightened by small animals hopping around his bed. He has no apparent focal weakness. Laboratory studies are normal. What is the best initial intervention to help prevent self-harm in this patient?

Delirium symptom management*

• Environment: noise reduction, intervention grouping

• Sleep facilitation: bright day/dim night lighting Nonpharmacologic • Personal interaction: reassurance, physical touch

• Constant observation: family, professional sitters

• Mobilization: out of bed, restraint avoidance

• Pain management: nonopioid when possible

Pharmacologic

• Antipsychotics: off-label indication

• Benzodiazepines: antipsychotic failure/withdrawal syndromes

*Deﬁnitive management is identiﬁcation and treatment of the underlying causes).

• A. Apply soft wrist restraints only at night (11%)

B. Discontinue all analgesics for pain (4%)

C. Employ a professional sitter at bedside (58%)

D. Restrict daytime interactions to maximize rest (8%)

• E. Schedule nighttime lorazepam for sleep (16%).

This postsurgical patient has acute mental status changes (eg, confusion, disorientation) associated with agitation and hallucinations, consistent with delirium. Postoperative delirium is a common surgical complication, and incidence increases with patient risk factors (eg, advanced age, dementia) and surgical complexity. Delirium is particularly prevalent after cardiac surgery, possibly due to cognitive dysfunction induced by cerebral microemboli related to cardiopulmonary bypass.

Management of delirium requires simultaneous control of behavioral symptoms and treatment of underlying causes. Nonpharmacologic measures (eg, sleep facilitation, mobilization) are the mainstays of delirium symptom management. Personal interaction (eg, reassurance, physical touch) can alleviate agitation and reduce the risk of self-harm. Familiar people (eg, relatives, friends) are the best resource; however, professional sitters can provide these interactions when no family members are available. In addition, sitters can provide constant observation, which decreases the need for physical restraints.

When agitation fails to respond to supportive care and patient danger persists, antipsychotic medications (eg, haloperidol, quetiapine) are often used. This indication is off-label and requires careful assessment of risks/beneﬁts, as well as close monitoring for adverse effects (ea. hypotension, QT prolongation). Physical restraints are a last resort and should be used

• A. Apply soft wrist restraints only at night (11%)

B. Discontinue all analgesics for pain (4%)

C. Employ a professional sitter at bedside (58%)

(Choice B) Opioids (eg, morphine) frequently cause delirium; however, uncontrolled pain often contributes to delirium, as well. Although nonopioid medications are preferred, opioids frequently are necessary in postoperative patients. Therefore, discontinuing all analgesics could aggravate pain-driven delirium and increase self-harm risk.

D. Restrict daytime interactions to maximize rest (8%)

• E. Schedule nighttime lorazepam for sleep (16%).

(Choice D) Restricting daytime interaction encourages sleep out of phase with natural lightdark cycles. This promotes sleep-wake reversal, which commonly precipitates or worsens delirium. Daytime nonpharmacologic measures (eg, personal interaction, mobilization) help maintain normal circadian rhythm.

This patient underwent epidural anesthesia 10 days ago and now has lumbar back pain, low-grade fever, and lower-extremity neurologic symptoms (eg, weakness, tingling, numbness), raising strong suspicion for spinal epidural abscess. Most cases arise via hematogenous spread of a distant infection, contiguous spread from an adjacent infection (eg, vertebral osteomyelitis), or following direct inoculation during spinal/epidural anesthesia.

The epidural space is a vertical, contiguous area that contains fat, arteries, and a venous plexus; infections tend to affect multiple spinal levels and cause progressive neurologic impairment due to direct spinal cord compression, thrombophlebitis of the draining venous plexus, and/or interruption of the arterial blood supply.

A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he fell headﬁrst down a ﬂight of stairs while intoxicated. According to friends who witnessed the fall, the patient landed on his head but did not lose consciousness. On arrival, blood pressure is 128/78 mm Hg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient smells of alcohol and is somnolent but can follow simple commands. There are facial abrasions. A rigid cervical collar is in place. Bilateral breath sounds are normal with no chest tenderness. Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The patient is moving all extremities spontaneously. He states that he is uncomfortable due to the cervical collar and requests that it be removed. Which of the following is the best immediate step for evaluating and ruling out cervical spine injury in this patient?

VO A. CT scan without contrast (37%).

Explanation

This patient who fell headﬁrst down a ﬂight of stairs and landed on his head may have a cervical spine (CS) injury.

Patients at high risk of CS injury (eg, high-energy mechanism, trauma causing concomitant closed head injury) automatically require CS imaging. Other patients, such as this one, who have a less severe trauma mechanism but some risk for CS injury are managed according to clinical decision rules such as the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) low-risk criteria. According to these criteria, CS imaging is necessary if any of the following is present:

• Neurologic deﬁcit

• B. Flexion and extension x-rays (4%).

C. MR imaging without contrast (9%)

D. Portable lateral x-ray (28%)

This patient is both somnolent and intoxicated; therefore, CS imaging is indicated. A CT scan of the CS without contrast is the preferred screening test to evaluate for CS injury, especially for fracture, because it is signiﬁcantly more sensitive than plain radiography (ie, ~98% vs ~52% sensitivity) (Choice D). If none of the NEXUS criteria are present, then imaging is not required; a normal neurologic examination is sufﬁcient to rule out CS injury and remove the collar (Choice E).

(Choice B) Flexion and extension x-rays are lateral views taken during CS ﬂexion and extension to assess for ligamentous injury. However, these views are not performed until after a CS fracture has been ruled out (eg, with a negative CT scan) and can be performed safely only in alert, cooperative patients (vs this somnolent, intoxicated patient).

(Choice C) MR imaging is not commonly performed as the primary screening test for CS injury; instead, it is typically performed when a CT scan suggests ligamentous or spinal cord injury, in order to better visualize the soft tissues. CT scan is quicker, cheaper, and better tolerated by patients than MRI.

A 38-year-old, right-handed woman is brought to the emergency department after a brief seizure witnessed by her husband. The patient has never before had a seizure but has had headaches for several weeks. Her husband says that she has acted strangely for several months. The patient used to be quite social, but lately, she is not motivated to participate in any social activities and has lost interest in everyday activities.She will not talk unless directly spoken to and has impaired memory. The patient has no signiﬁcant medical or psychiatric history. There is no family history of neurologic disorders. Temperature is 36 C (96.8 F), blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, and pulse is 86/min. On examination, the patient is somnolent but wakes to voice and follows commands. The pupils are equal and reactive. Funduscopy reveals bilateral papilledema.Bilateral upper and lower extremity muscle strength is normal. Neuroimaging is most likely to reveal which of the following ﬁndings in this patient?

Explanation

This patient's presentation is most consistent with a frontal lobe tumor. Brain tumors can be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic until increased intracranial pressure (ICP) causes headache (classically worse with recumbency), with ICP transmission to the optic nerve sometimes leading to papilledema. Other common manifestations include an unprovoked ﬁrst seizure (as seen in this patient), focal deﬁcits, and cognitive dysfunction (eg, impaired

memory).

Speciﬁc deﬁcits, which are sometimes subtle and present for weeks to months, help with tumor localization. Frontal lobe involvement can affect personality, language, motor, or executive functions (eg, planning, inhibition, attention). This patient's personality changes (eg, acting strangely) over the past few months likely reﬂect a frontal lobe mass. Although frontal lobe damage classically causes disinhibition and impulsiveness, it may also lead to depressive symptoms, including decreased motivation and/or lack of concern regarding the diagnosis (ie, abulia) and loss of interest (ie, anhedonia), as seen in this patient.

(Choice A) Frontotemporal dementia, which preferentially affects the frontal lobe, is often characterized by personality changes and executive dysfunction. However, it typically has a hereditary component, is most common in patients age 50-70, and does not classically cause

headaches or papilledema.

A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to pain in his left index finger.

Explanation

He accidentally cut the ﬁnger with a sharp knife while cooking 20 minutes ago. The patient reports that his wife helped him wash it thoroughly immediately after the incident and applied pressure prior to driving him to the hospital. He has no medical history, and his tetanus vaccination is up to date. Vital signs are normal.On examination, the patient has a 2-cm linear laceration to the pulp of the left index ﬁnger, with slow active bleeding. There are no obvious foreign bodies. Active and passive range of motion at the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints are normal. Digital block is performed using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate prior to irrigation and repair. Which of the following is the most likely beneﬁt of adding sodium bicarbonate to the anesthetic agent?

C)UWorld

Version

This patient requiring ﬁngertip laceration repair is undergoing a digital block using lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate. Lidocaine, a common local anesthetic, reversibly blocks sodium channels within neuronal cell membranes, preventing depolarization and transmission of pain signals. Like other local anesthetics, lidocaine is a weak base (eg, pKa ~7.7); however, it is marketed in acidic form (eg, pH 4-6) to increase its stability and shelf life.

When injected in its acidic form, the lidocaine solution causes intense pain. Therefore, it is commonly buffered with sodium bicarbonate (typically by adding 1 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution to 10 mL of 1% lidocaine) to decrease its acidity (ie, increase its pH) and the resultant pain of injection. Increasing the pH also may increase the onset of analgesia

When injected in its acidic form, the lidocaine solution causes intense pain. Therefore, it is commonly buffered with sodium bicarbonate (typically by adding 1 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution to 10 mL of 1% lidocaine) to decrease its acidity (ie, increase its pH) and the resultant pain of injection. Increasing the pH also may increase the onset of analgesia by converting more local anesthetic into its uncharged, active form.

In contrast, the addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic solutions causes vasoconstriction at the site of the injection, which results in the following:

• Decreased bleeding during wound repair (Choice A)

• Decreased absorption of lidocaine into the systemic circulation, reducing the risk of lidocaine toxicity (Choice C)

• A. Decreasing bleeding during wound closure (13%).

B. Decreasing pain during anesthetic injection (30%)

• Prolonged duration of analgesia (eg, from 1-2 hours to 2-4 hours for 1% lidocaine vs 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, respectively)

C. Preventing lidocaine toxicity (44%)

D. Reducing bacterial concentration (10%)

Epinephrine is used with caution for digital blocks in healthy patients and is contraindicated in those with increased risk of digital ischemia (eg, peripheral artery disease, Raynaud phenomenon) because the digital arteries (the primary blood supply to the ﬁnger) are in such close proximity to the digital nerves.

(Choice D) Reduction of bacterial concentration is accomplished by thorough irrigation of the wound prior to repair; normal saline or tap water are sufﬁcient to irrigate the wound without damaging the tissue. Neither lidocaine nor sodium bicarbonate have bactericidal activity or reduce bacterial concentration.

Educational objective:

version

Lidocaine, a common local anesthetic, is typically buffered with sodium bicarbonate; this raises the solution's pH, reducing the pain associated with injection and increasing the onset of

analgesia. In contrast, addition of epinephrine causes vasoconstriction, decreased bleeding, reduced systemic absorption of lidocaine, and prolonged analgesic effect.

A 55-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department due to worsening headaches and right-sided weakness. The patient developed these headaches a month ago and since then has had continuous throbbing pain over the left side of her head that is associated with nausea. More recently, she has noticed increasing difﬁculty using her right arm and leg. The patient has had no trauma, neck stiffness, fever, double or blurry vision, or photophobia. She recently emigrated from Mexico with her family.She is a retired seamstress and admits to chronic tobacco use for many years. Her temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respirations are 14/min. Neurologic examination is signiﬁcant for right-sided pronator drift. A non-contrast head CT scan reveals a partially calciﬁed round extra-axial mass compressing the left frontal lobe, as shown in this exhibit. The mass appears dural-based and homogeneously enhances on post-gadolinium MRI. Which of the following is the most appropriate next course of action in management of this patient?

The mass appears dural-based and homogeneously enhances on post-gadolinium MRI. Which of the following is the most appropriate next course of action in management of this patient?

This patient's presenting symptoms and imaging ﬁndings are consistent with an expanding intracranial neoplasm.The presence of an extra-axial well-circumscribed or round homogenously enhancing dural-based mass on MRI is strongly suggestive of a meningioma. These tumors usually undergo calciﬁcation and can appear hyperdense on non-contrast head CT scan.

Meningiomas are considered to be benign primary brain tumors arising from meningothelial cells and are more commonly found in middle-age to elderly women. They can cause signiﬁcant neurologic symptoms (eg, headache, seizure, focal weakness/numbness) if they become large enough to cause mass effect on critical neurovascular structures. The diagnosis of meningioma is conﬁrmed intraoperatively and the treatment of choice in symptomatic patients is typically complete resection as this leads to a cure in most individuals.

• A. Chemotherapy (2%)

B. Combination antitubercular therapy (5%)

• C. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (26%)

(Choice A) Chemotherapy is not considered ﬁrst-line treatment for meningioma. Chemotherapy may be coupled with surgical resection and radiation in patients with highly malignant primary brain tumors (eg, glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma). It can also be considered in patients with highly chemosensitive metastatic brain disease (eg, due to testicular germ cell tumor).

• D. Surgical resection (65%)

• E. Whole brain radiation (0%).

(Choice B) Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol may be used to treat tuberculosis, which can cause meningitis and rarely intracerebral tuberculoma in patients from endemic areas (eg, Mexico and other developing countries).Tuberculosis is less likely in this patient given the absence of systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, night sweats) or chronic cough.

Hemoglobin 11 g/dL Platelets 260,000/mm3 Leukocytes 16,300/mm3

What is the best next step in management of this patient?

Features of this patient's presentation suggest spinal epidural abscess (SEA). He has conditions that lead to an immunocompromised state (eg, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use), and he was assaulted. Trauma is a signiﬁcant risk factor for SEA via development of a hematoma that may expand and become infected. This patient's neck pain and stiffness progressed over days to include a sore throat (from extension of the abscess into the retropharyngeal space) and radiating pain. He had fever and focal neurologic ﬁndings (eg, weakness of left upper extremity); laboratory analysis revealed leukocytosis.

The classic triad of SEA includes the following:

• Spinal pain, often focal with progression to radiculopathic pain (eg, radiating, shooting, electric-shock sensation)

• Neurologic deﬁcits, often progressive as the abscess expands and referable to the level of compression (eg, weakness, sensory changes, bowel/bladder dysregulation)

• A. Contrast esophagography (4%)

• B. CT scan of the head (16%)

• C. Direct laryngoscopy (5%)

• D. MR angiography of the neck vessels (12%)

• E. MRI of the cervical spine with contrast (61%).

• Fever (~50% of patients) All are present in a minority of patients. Fever is most commonly absent, but patients often have other signs of infection (eg, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate). MRI of the cervical spine with contrast should be performed because it can show early evidence of the presence and extent of infection that often cannot be seen with CT scan or plain x-rays. (Choice A) Contrast esophagography (using water-soluble contrast) can demonstrate esophageal rupture, which can occur after blunt trauma, causing pain, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Esophageal rupture typically presents within a few hours with signs of gastric

contents leaking into the chest or neck (eg, pleural effusion, neck crepitus).

(Choice B) CT scan of the head can visualize intracranial hemorrhage, which can present with focal neurologic deﬁcits, often due to head trauma. Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage typically presents within hours of injury (vs 7 days), and patients typically have altered mental status. Sore throat and radicular pain would not be present.

A 42-year-old woman is evaluated in the postoperative care unit for sudden-onset tachycardia and dyspnea 15 minutes after surgery. The patient underwent a dilation and curettage for gestational trophoblastic diseases complicated by intraoperative bleeding that required 2 units of packed red blood cells. The bleeding was controlled, and the remainder of the procedure and subsequent extubation were uneventful. The patient has a 10-packyear smoking history but no other medical conditions or prior surgeries.She takes no daily medications.Temperature is 37.8 C (100 F), blood pressure is 160/110 mm Hg, pulse is 134/min, and respirations are 38/min. The patient appears diaphoretic and has shallow, labored breathing. Cardiac examination shows sinus tachycardia with no rubs or murmurs. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen has no marked distension, rebound, or guarding. Bilateral extremities have generalized rigidity. The Foley catheter is draining brown-appearing urine. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this

patient?

Explanation

Malignant hyperthermia

• Genetic mutation alters control of intracellular calcium

Epidemiology

• Triggered by volatile anesthetics, succinylcholine, excessive heat

• Masseter muscle/generalized rigidity

• Sinus tachycardia

• Hypercarbia resistant to increased minute ventilation

Manifestations

• Rhabdomyolysis

• Hyperkalemia

• Hyperthermia (late manifestation)

• Respiratory/ventilatory support

A. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (10%)

Treatment

• Immediate cessation of causative anesthetic

B. Malignant hyperthermia (44%)

C. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (19%)

• Dantrolene

• D. Pulmonary embolism (6%).

• E. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (19%)

This patient developed tachycardia, dyspnea, generalized muscle rigidity, and dark urine soon after general anesthesia, raising strong suspicion for malignant hyperthermia (MH). MH is an autosomal dominant or sporadic skeletal muscle receptor disorder marked by excessive calcium release following exposure to succinylcholine or a volatile anesthetic (eg, halothane).

In MH, sustained muscle contraction leads to:

The patient appears diaphoretic and has shallow, labored breathing. Cardiac examination shows sinus tachycardia with no rubs or murmurs. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen has no marked distension, rebound, or guarding. Bilateral extremities have generalized rigidity. The Foley catheter is draining brown-appearing urine. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this

patient?

• myoglobinuria, as seen in this patient with dark urine (due to muscle breakdown)

• hyperthermia (late manifestation due to the sustained contractions generating more energy than the body can dissipate; not usually present initially).

Most cases arise shortly after induction or during maintenance of anesthesia, but symptoms can occur soon after anesthetic cessation. Urgent treatment with dantrolene (a skeletal muscle relaxant) and supportive care are required to prevent death.

(Choice A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be due to ABO-incompatible blood transfusion but is most common with infection, malignancy, trauma, and obstetric complications. It generally presents with bleeding symptoms such as oozing from catheters, drains, or incisions. Muscle rigidity would be atypical.

A. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (10%)

B. Malignant hyperthermia (44%)

C. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (19%)

(Choice C) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is often associated with rigidity, myoglobinuria, tachypnea, and tachycardia. However, it is caused by administration of a neuroleptic agent (eg, haloperidol, ﬂuphenazine), not by surgery or surgical anesthesia. In addition, most cases progress over a few days, not minutes.

• D. Pulmonary embolism (6%).

• E. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (19%)

(Choice D) Pulmonary embolism is a common complication of surgery and is frequently associated with sinus tachycardia and dyspnea. However, most cases occur >24 hours after surgery (not immediately) due to immobility. Furthermore, muscle rigidity and dark urine would be uncommon.

Malignant hyperthermia is a genetic disorder associated with sudden-onset tachypnea, tachycardia, myoglobinuria, and masseter/generalized muscle rigidity following exposure to succinylcholine or a volatile anesthetic. Most cases arise during or shortly after induction, but symptoms are sometimes delayed until just after anesthesia cessation.

This patient with a gunshot wound to his posterior neck, resulting in an inability to move his extremities, likely has a high cervical spinal cord injury (above C5). Respiratory examination reveals severely reduced inspiratory effort and poor air movement, which is concerning for

hypercapnic respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic paralysis.

Patients with a high cervical spine injury are at risk for immediate diaphragmatic paralysis

because the diaphragm is innervated by cervical nerve roots from C3-C5. In addition, this patient is likely in neurogenic shock due to interruption of descending sympathetic ﬁbers, which results in unopposed parasympathetic stimulation of the vessels (ie, hypotension) and heart (ie, bradycardia).

As in all trauma patients, primary survey of a patient with penetrating neck trauma includes assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation.

(Choice B) Cricothyroidotomy can be performed when other, less invasive techniques of airway management have failed or are likely to fail (eg, oral or maxillofacial trauma). Although this patient has trauma to the neck, there is no neck swelling or alteration in anatomy indicating that orotracheal intubation would be unsuccessful.

(Choice C) CT of the cervical spine should eventually be obtained in this patient; however, it should be performed only after stabilizing immediate, life-threatening issues (ie, airway, breathing, circulation). This patient with hypercapnic respiratory failure and neurogenic shock due to a high spinal cord injury should not be taken for imaging until these issues have been addressed.

Version

(Choice E) Packed red blood cells are indicated in patients who are hypotensive from hemorrhagic shock, which is characterized by hypotension and tachycardia in patients with signiﬁcant blood loss.This patient's hypotension and bradycardia in the presence of a spinal cord injury suggest neurogenic shock.

Educational objective:

High spinal cord injuries (above C5) can lead to hypercapnic respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic paralysis. Even in patients with unstable cervical spine injuries, orotracheal intubation (with manual stabilization of the cervical spine) should be performed.

This patient who likely fell down a stairwell has poor neurologic status (eg, Glasgow coma score of 7), which is concerning for severe traumatic brain injury. Given that his initial head CT scan was unremarkable (eg, no large hematoma), this presentation is most consistent with

diffuse axonal injury (DAI).

2023

version

Sudden acceleration-deceleration or rotational forces during blunt head trauma can cause shearing of the long, white matter tracts (ie, axons) of the brain. This particularly affects junctions between brain tissues of different densities (eg, gray-white matter junction), which experience mismatched changes in velocity in response to the external forces. Axonal injury occurs when the shearing forces break the axonal cytoskeleton, leading to impairment of axonal transport, swelling, and potential degeneration of the axon.

Because these injuries occur on a microscopic level, DAl may not be apparent on initial head CT, which is typically performed without contrast to detect macroscopic bleeding or skull fractures. However, MRI is more sensitive than CT for DAl and can often reveal numerous

minute punctate hemorrhages in the white matter (ie, axons) and blurring of the graywhite interface (due to edema).

Correct answer

(Choices A and D) Blunt head trauma can cause rapid hematoma formation capable of compressing and displacing brain tissue (ie, brain herniation). When severe, this can result in tonsillar herniation (ie, downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum) or subfalcine herniation (ie, lateral shift in midline structures inferior to the falx cerebri) accompanied by unconsciousness. In contrast to patients with brain herniation, patients with DAl typically experience unconsciousness in the absence of major neuroimaging ﬁndings (eg, hematoma, herniation).

Answered correctly

Time Spent

(Choice B) A generalized decrease in cerebral volume (ie, cerebral atrophy) is often a longterm consequence of traumatic brain injury and can contribute to progressive cognitive and functional decline. However, this occurs over months to years after the trauma.

2023 :: Version

(Choice C) Hyperdense blood in the basal cisterns, which typically appears immediately on noncontrast CT as white, hyperdense regions in the brain parenchyma, is more characteristically associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage can occur due to head trauma and, if severe, result in a decreased level of consciousness. However, because DAl occurs due to microscopic damage to axons rather than bleeding into the subarachnoid space, it may not be seen on initial CT scan of the head.

Educational objective:

Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) often causes severe neurologic impairment in the absence of major CT scan ﬁndings. MRI is more sensitive for DAl and may reveal minute punctate hemorrhages in the white matter and blurring of the gray-white interface.

A 64-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance for right-sided weakness and slurred speech that started 30 minutes ago. The wife reports that her husband said he was dizzy, and shortly after, he developed acute right arm and leg weakness and was unable to speak. Medical history includes hypertension, for which he takes amlodipine. The patient also takes an aspirin daily. Blood pressure is 225/110 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, the patient is alert but aphasic with 0/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities. Examination of the left upper and lower extremities is normal. A nicardipine infusion is started and CT scan of the head is performed. After returning from the CT scanner, the patient is minimally responsive and has developed hyperextension of all four extremities. CT scan shows a left-sided intracerebral hemorrhage with a 5-mm midline shift to the right. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

This patient had a stroke (eg, slurred speech, dizziness, right-sided weakness) due to hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. On initial presentation, he was alert and breathing spontaneously; however, his condition subsequently deteriorated, and he became unresponsive due to continued hemorrhage expansion causing brain herniation (eg, midline shift on CT scan, decerebrate posturing). In a patient, such as this one, with a rapid change in clinical status, the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) should be reassessed.

Brain herniation can rapidly lead to respiratory failure for several reasons, including the following:

• B. A. Administer Administer intravenous corticosteroids (2%) intravenous mannitol (21%)

• A decreased level of consciousness (ie, Glasgow Coma Score <8) results in an inability

to protect the airway.

• Dysfunction of cranial nerve nuclei results in loss of speciﬁc airway protective reﬂexes (eg, cough, gag).

C. Discontinue aspirin and transfuse platelets (6%)

Answered correctly

• Compression of respiratory centers in the brainstem causes decreased ventilatory drive, leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia.

Because this patient with brain herniation has now become unresponsive and unable to protect his airway, the best next step in management is intubation and mechanical ventilation (airway and breathing of the ABCs). Subsequent management can then focus on preventing further bleeding (eg, reversing anticoagulation, controlling blood pressure) and lowering the intracranial pressure (eg, hyperventilation, osmotic agents [eg, mannitol], neurosurgical hematoma evacuation).

2023

Version

(Choice A) Although corticosteroids are used to decrease some forms of cerebral edema (eg, vasogenic edema surrounding brain tumors), there is no evidence to support their routine use in patients with hemorrhagic stroke.

(Choice B) Osmotic therapy (eg, hypertonic saline, mannitol) may be used to treat elevated intracranial pressure in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. However, protection of the airway by intubation and restoration of breathing through mechanical ventilation take precedence.

A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to recurrent left-sided weakness.The patient experienced similar symptoms a month ago, when he was found to have a small ischemic stroke in the right middle cerebral artery territory. Evaluation revealed an atherosclerotic stenosis in the right internal carotid artery, and a percutaneous stent was placed 2 weeks later. The patient did not follow up after stent placement but reports that his weakness was improving. On waking today, he noticed worsening of the left-sided weakness and new slurring of speech. Medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic tobacco use. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 142/86 mm Hg, and pulse is 80/min and regular. Physical examination shows left-sided facial droop, dysarthria, and left-sided hemiplegia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?

Explanation

This patient had symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis that caused a small ischemic stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery, a branch of the ICA. He underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS), then developed worsening left-sided weakness and dysarthria (ie, disordered speech due to facial muscle weakness) 2 weeks later. This presentation is most consistent with a periprocedural stroke resulting from an in-stent thrombosis of the carotid

stent.

• A. Carotid artery dissection

Compared with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), a high-risk neurosurgical procedure used in some cases of carotid artery stenosis, CAS is less invasive and may have similar long-term outcomes for stroke prevention. However, CAS is associated with a higher risk for periprocedural stroke and mortality than CEA, so it is typically reserved for patients who are poor surgical candidates.

B. Carotid baroreceptor stimulation

C. Carotid in-stent thrombosis

• D. Carotid intimal hyperplasia

• E. Cerebral hyperperfusion

Periprocedural stroke is the most common complication following CAS. It can develop due to different etiologies, which can often be distinguished by the timing of symptom onset:

• Thromboembolism may occur at the time of stent placement, typically from atherosclerotic plaque breaking loose from the vessel wall during the procedure.

• In-stent thrombosis most often occurs within the ﬁrst 30 days following stent placement. Nonadherence to postprocedure antiplatelet therapy and continued tobacco use increase the risk.

A 24-year-old man comes to the emergency department for evaluation of eye pain and swelling. He was involved in an altercation last night after signiﬁcant alcohol use but does not remember any further details. The patient has double vision when he attempts to look up. On examination, the left side of the face is signiﬁcantly swollen, tender, and ecchymotic. Visual acuity is normal. He is unable to look up with his left eye. CT scan is

This patient sustained facial trauma and now is unable to look up with his left eye. Blunt trauma to the globe often causes a rapid increase in pressure that is transmitted posteriorly into the orbit, causing fracture of the weakest areas of the bony orbit (ie, orbital ﬂoor, medial orbital wall). This hydraulic transfer of force (ie, "blowout" fracture) protects the globe from rupture.

All patients who sustain orbital trauma should undergo assessment of visual acuity and extraocular movements. CT scan is obtained if there is evidence of a fracture (eg, step-off on palpation), changes in vision or extraocular movements, or the examination is limited due to soft-tissue swelling or altered mental status.

This patient's coronal CT scan shows a left orbital ﬂoor fracture with herniation of orbital fat into the maxillary sinus and entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle. An entrapped inferior rectus keeps the affected globe in a downward position, leading to diplopia on upward gaze despite normal visual acuity. Prolonged entrapment may cause ischemia, ﬁbrosis, and permanent dysfunction. Therefore, if there is concern for muscle entrapment either on examination or CT scan, the patient should be seen by a surgical subspecialist (eg, plastic surgeon, ophthalmologist) within 24 hours.

(Choice B) Open globe injury can also occur with facial trauma. However, patients with this

injury have markedly decreased visual acuity, and CT scan would show a ﬂattened appearance of the globe.

Which of the following is the most likely reason for this patient's diplopia?

• A. Muscle entrapment (53%)

(Choice C) Orbital cellulitis can present with swelling, pain, and impaired extraocular movements. However, patients also typically have fever and diffuse (rather than just upward gaze) restriction of ocular movement.

B. Open globe injury (19%)

C. Orbital cellulitis (1%)

• D. Orbital hematoma (16%)

(Choice D) An orbital hematoma can occur after facial trauma and present with diplopia. However, patients with hematoma have markedly decreased visual acuity due to pressureinduced ischemia of the optic nerve, and CT scan would show intraorbital ﬂuid rather than an orbital ﬂoor fracture.

E. Trochlear nerve (CN IV) injury (8%)

Omitted

(Choice E) Trochlear nerve (CN IV) dysfunction can present with vertical diplopia after trauma. However, because CN IV innervates the superior oblique muscle, the vertical diplopia is present on downward (rather than upward) gaze, and examination shows hypertropia and extorsion of the eye.

The following vignette applies to the next 2 items. The items in this set must be answered in sequential order. Once you click Proceed to Next Item, you will not be able to add or change an answer.

A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which he was a restrained driver. Although the airbags deployed, the patient's leg smashed against the front console and he had to be extricated from the vehicle. The emergency medical team placed him in a rigid cervical collar and transported him to the hospital on a backboard. He received intravenous ﬂuids en route. Blood pressure is 138/92 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 14/min. The patient is alert and oriented but has signiﬁcant leg pain. Bilateral breath sounds are equal with no chest tenderness. Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender. There is no pelvic tenderness. The right lower leg is grossly deformed, with an exposed, broken tibia. Capillary reﬁll is <2 seconds in both feet. Plain x-rays of the right leg show comminuted fractures of the tibia and ﬁbula.

Item 1 of 2

Which additional imaging study is most appropriate to obtain at this time?

Explanation

This patient's evaluation (as with any trauma patient) began with a primary survey, which showed an intact airway, normal breathing, and hemodynamic stability. Adjunct imaging that often follows the primary survey includes portable chest and pelvic x-rays, Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST), and cervical spine imaging.

Cervical spine imaging should be performed whenever there is a high-energy mechanism of injury (eg, high-speed motor vehicle collision, fall ≥3 m [10 ft], trauma causing concomitant closed-head injury). Even when a high-risk mechanism is not present, imaging may still be indicated according to clinical decision rules (eg, NEXUS [National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study] low-risk criteria). Any 1 of the following is an indication for cervical spine

imaging:

• Neurologic deﬁcit

• Spinal tenderness

• Altered mental status

• Intoxication

• Distracting injury

• A. CT angiography of the lower extremities (23%)

• B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (16%)

• C. CT scan of the cervical spine (39%).

• D. CT scan of the chest (3%)

• E. No additional imaging (16%)

This patient has both a high-energy mechanism of injury (ie, high-speed motor vehicle collision) and a painful, distracting injury (open right tibia-ﬁbula fracture). Therefore, he should undergo cervical spine imaging (Choice E). CT scan of the cervical spine is the preferred screening test to evaluate for cervical spine injury because it is signiﬁcantly more sensitive than plain radiography (eg, ~98% vs ~52% sensitivity). Imaging should be done prior to performing urgent surgical intervention (eg, irrigation, ﬁxation) for the patient's open fracture because he may require orotracheal intubation and neck manipulation.

(Choice A) CT angiography of the lower extremities may be indicated if clinical signs of vascular injury (eg, diminished pulses) are present following trauma. Although tibia-ﬁbula fractures may be associated with vascular injury in some patients, this patient has normal capillary reﬁll (ie, <2 sec) in both feet. Complete pulse examination and measurement of the injured extremity index (analogous to the ankle-brachial index) would be better next steps than CT angiography.

(Choices B and D) Portable chest and pelvic x-rays and FAST are commonly performed as adjuncts to the primary survey.

CT scan of the cervical spine shows a minimally displaced fracture of the right C5 lamina, with slight subluxation of the right C5-C6 facet joint. On further examination, the patient has mild weakness of right wrist extension and loss of pinprick sensation in the right thumb. Which of the following additional studies should be obtained?

• A. Barium esophagography (2%)

• B. Carotid ultrasound (25%),

This patient's CT scan reveals a C5 right lamina fracture, a fracture that can occur with neck hyperextension (eg, head impacting an expanded airbag). If the fracture causes osteoligamentous injury to the adjacent facet (eg, right C5-C6 facet joint), unilateral facet joint subluxation may occur. The subluxation can compress the associated spinal nerve root and cause monoradiculopathy, as seen in this patient with signs of C6 radiculopathy (eg, weak wrist extension, thumb sensory loss).

The presence of a single vertebral fracture (especially cervical) in a patient with blunt trauma is an indication to image the entire spine because the risk of a second, noncontiguous vertebral fracture is as high as 20%. Other indications for imaging the thoracolumbar spine (TLS) include focal pain or signs of injury (eg, bruising, step-off), corresponding neurologic deﬁcit, altered mental status or distracting injury, and high-energy mechanism (eg, high-speed motor vehicle collision, fall ≥3 m [10 ft]). Because CT scan is more sensitive and accurate than plain radiography for diagnosing TLS injury, it is the screening modality of choice in patients with any of the above indications.

(Choice A) Because the esophagus lies anterior to the cervical spinal column, cervical spine injury can sometimes cause esophageal perforation (which barium esophagography can evaluate). However, this complication is very rare (<1%) compared to concomitant TLS fracture (~20%). Routine screening is not performed, but evaluation would be appropriate if the patient later develops dysphagia, odynophagia, and/or subcutaneous emphysema.

(Choice B) Cervical trauma can rarely injure the carotid arteries, causing dissection or

occlusion (which might be seen on carotid ultrasound). However, symptoms related to dissection or occlusion (eg, hemiparesis, headache, Horner syndrome) would be expected. This patient's symptoms are most consistent with C6 radiculopathy.

(Choice D) A nerve conduction study is commonly performed to localize the site of peripheral nerve injury/compression (eg, carpal tunnel), usually in order to direct treatment (eg, carpal tunnel release). This patient's symptoms are more consistent with right C6 radiculopathy (ie, nerve root compression) than with peripheral neuropathy and are already explained by the right C5-C6 facet joint subluxation.

There is mild weakness of the elbow ﬂexion and biceps reﬂex is decreased on the left side. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Cervical radiculopathies occur due to compression of a spinal nerve root; in addition to sensorimotor deﬁcits that follow the pattern of the affected nerve root, most patients also report neck or shoulder/arm pain. Lateral ﬂexion and rotation of the neck (as occurs when cradling a phone between the head and shoulder) narrows the ipsilateral neural foramina, worsening compression of the nerve root. Worsening limb pain and paresthesia in response to lateral neck ﬂexion is relatively speciﬁc for cervical radiculopathy, although worsening pain in the neck with this maneuver is not. In contrast, shoulder abduction reduces tension on the impinged nerve root, and improvement of radicular symptoms when the hand is placed on the top of the head (ie, shoulder abduction relief test) can be both diagnostic and therapeutic for short-term pain relief.

• B. Peripheral nerve demyelination (0%)

• C. Spinal cord demyelination (0%)

• D. Spinal nerve root compression (84%)

E. Ulnar nerve compression (1%)

(Choice A) Although median nerve injury can result in sensory deﬁcits of the thumb and index ﬁnger, it would not cause weakness of elbow ﬂexion or a diminished biceps. Neck pain is unexpected.

(Choice B) Peripheral nerve demyelination (eg, chronic inﬂammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) typically results in symmetric sensorimotor deﬁcits, rather than deﬁcits conﬁned to a portion of one limb.

(Choice C) Spinal cord demyelination (eg, transverse myelitis) typically results in deﬁcits affecting all areas below the level of injury. Symptoms would not be limited to a single dermatome. Furthermore, it would likely result in upper motor neuron signs (eg, hyperreﬂexia), rather than hyporeﬂexia.

Lateral ﬂexion and rotation of the neck worsens compression of the nerve root, worsening pain and/or paresthesia.

A 70-year-old man is undergoing left carotid endarterectomy. Three weeks ago, he experienced a minor ischemic stroke with residual, mild weakness of the right upper extremity. Stroke evaluation revealed a 90% occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. Other medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia. A left carotid arteriotomy, followed by plaque removal through a neck incision, is performed with no intraoperative complications.Six hours postoperatively, the patient is noted to have speech disturbances and facial asymmetry. Blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg and pulse is 88/min. On physical examination, the patient is awake and alert and has slurred speech. There is drooping of the right corner of the mouth and ﬂattening of the right nasolabial fold. Weakness of the right-sided extremities (the arm more than the leg) is present. There is also hemisensory loss on the right side. Immediately obtained noncontrast CT scan of the head shows no hemorrhage.

A 70-year-old man is undergoing left carotid endarterectomy. Three weeks ago, he experienced a minor ischemic stroke with residual, mild weakness of the right upper

extremity. Stroke evaluation revealed a 90% occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. Other medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia. A left carotid arteriotomy, followed by plaque removal through a neck incision, is performed with no intraoperative complications.Six hours postoperatively, the patient is noted to have speech disturbances and facial asymmetry. Blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg and pulse is 88/min. On physical examination, the patient is awake and alert and has slurred speech. There is drooping of the right corner of the mouth and ﬂattening of the right nasolabial fold. Weakness of the right-sided extremities (the arm more than the leg) is present. There is also hemisensory loss on the right side. Immediately obtained noncontrast CT scan of the head shows no hemorrhage. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms?

•• A. Carotid artery thromboembolism (58%)

This patient with symptomatic (eg, minor ischemic stroke), high-grade (eg, 70%-99% occlusion) carotid artery stenosis underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Postoperatively, he developed dysarthria, hemiparesis, and hemisensory loss (right face, arm, leg), consistent with a stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, which arises from the internal carotid artery. CT scan of the head showed no areas of hemorrhage. This presentation is most consistent with postoperative carotid artery thromboembolism, a known complication of

CEA.

CEA is indicated in some patients with carotid artery stenosis to reduce risk of stroke. It involves surgically opening the carotid artery and removing the obstructing atherosclerotic plaque and associated endothelium. The procedure can cause ischemic brain injury due to plaque emboli or thrombosis (from endothelial irritation). Other mechanisms of post-CEA stroke include relative cerebral hypotension, carotid dissection, or hematoma. Given these potential complications, decisions regarding which patients should be offered CEA is based on comparing risk of surgery with that of future stroke. Calculations are based on the presence of symptoms and degree of stenosis.

• B. Cerebral hyperperfusion (18%)

• C. Global cerebral ischemia (5%)

• D. latrogenic nerve injury (8%)

• E. Vertebral artery dissection (8%)

(Choice B) Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome is a potential complication of CEA that occurs when restoration of carotid artery blood ﬂow causes a dramatic increase in cerebral perfusion pressure across capillary beds that were dilated to improve cerebral oxygenation. This increase in blood ﬂow classically leads to vessel rupture, which would likely appear as areas of hemorrhage on CT scan and often presents with seizures (due to the irritative effect of extravascular blood).

(Choice C) Global cerebral ischemia occurs when all blood ﬂow to the brain ceases (eg, during cardiac arrest). Areas most at risk include the hippocampus (eg, anterograde amnesia) and watershed areas (eg, cortical blindness, weakness of the shoulders and thighs). Unilateral deﬁcits are uncommon.

version

(Choice D) latrogenic nerve injury can occur during CEA, most commonly affecting the vagus (CN X) or hypoglossal (CN XII) nerves, which can lead to speech difﬁculties. However, this would not explain hemisensory loss or weakness of the arms or legs.

(Choice E) CEA often requires neck extension and torsion, which could conceivably lead to a vertebral artery dissection. However, this most commonly presents as lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome (eg, involvement of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, the largest

This patient has sensory and motor deﬁcits consistent with a femoral nerve injury. The femoral nerve innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh (ie, quadriceps femoris, sartorius, pectineus) and is responsible for knee extension and hip ﬂexion. It also provides sensation to the anterior thigh (via the anterior cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve) and medial leg (via the saphenous branch). Patients with femoral nerve injury also have decreased patellar reﬂex, as the reﬂex involves the quadriceps muscle.

This patient most likely has an injury to which of the following nerves?

provides sensation to the anterior thigh (via the anterior cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve) and medial leg (via the saphenous branch). Patients with femoral nerve injury also have decreased patellar reﬂex, as the reﬂex involves the quadriceps muscle.

The femoral nerve is vulnerable to injury from pelvic fracture, hip dislocation, or hematoma (eg, iliacus). It can also suffer iatrogenic injury during prolonged maintenance of the dorsal lithotomy position (eg, hip/pelvic surgery, childbirth) or vascular procedures involving the femoral artery or vein. Anesthesia for the anterior thigh and knee can be provided by a femoral nerve block, with injection of anesthetic in the inguinal crease below the inguinal ligament at the lateral border of the femoral artery.

• A. Common peroneal (8%)

(Choice A) Injury to the common peroneal nerve is typically caused by fracture or compression at the proximal ﬁbula. Sensory symptoms occur at the posterolateral leg and dorsolateral foot and are often associated with footdrop due to weakness of foot eversion, dorsiﬂexion, and toe extension.

B. Femoral (81%)

C. Ilioinguinal (1%)

D. Obturator (3%)

(Choice C) The ilioinguinal nerve provides sensory innervation to the upper medial thigh and genital region. It accompanies the spermatic cord through the superﬁcial inguinal ring; injury during pelvic or hernia surgery can lead to chronic suprapubic or groin pain.

• E. Tibial (4%)

(Choice D) The obturator nerve innervates the medial compartment of the thigh (ie, gracilis, adductor longus, adductor brevis, anterior portion of adductor magnus). Injury would lead to weakness of hip adduction and decreased sensation at the medial thigh.

(Choice E) The tibial nerve is the larger of the two terminal branches of the sciatic nerve. Injury at the popliteal fossa may result in weakness of plantar ﬂexion (due to denervation of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles). Compression of the nerve as it passes under the ﬂexor retinaculum in the medial side of the ankle can cause numbness and paresthesias in the sole and distal toes (tarsal tunnel syndrome).

Educational objective:

The femoral nerve is responsible for knee extension and hip ﬂexion and provides sensation to the anterior thigh and medial leg. It is vulnerable to injury from pelvic fracture, hip dislocation, or iliacus hematoma and can suffer iatrogenic injury during prolonged maintenance of the dorsal lithotomy position (eg, hip/pelvic surgery, childbirth) or vascular procedures involving the femoral artery or vein.

A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. When the patient was extracted from the damaged car, he was responsive and had a blood pressure of 180/90 mm Hg and a pulse of 120/min. The emergency medical team applied a cervical collar, placed him on a back board, and began intravenous ﬂuid resuscitation. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient is awake, alert, anxious, and reporting neck pain. Temperature is 35.5 C (95.9 F), blood pressure is 84/52 mm Hg, pulse is 50/min, and respirations are 20/min. There are small facial abrasions and bruising over the chest and abdominal wall, but no other obvious external injuries or signs of active bleeding. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Neck veins are ﬂat. Bilateral breath sounds are equal, and heart sounds are normal. Abdominal examination reveals a palpable mass in the suprapubic region. The patient is unable to move any of his extremities, and deep tendon reﬂexes are diffusely absent. Sensation to pinprick is absent below the neck. Which of the following best explains this patient's current cardiovascular status?

Explanation

This patient's complete loss of spinal cord function (eg, areﬂexia, anesthesia, paralysis, distended bladder) is associated with bradycardia, hypotension, and hypothermia, raising

strong suspicion for neurogenic shock due to a traumatic spinal cord injury (in the cervical spine). Acute spinal cord injury is generally associated with an initial period (several minutes) of massive sympathetic stimulation (leading to hypertension and tachycardia) due to release of norepinephrine from the adrenal glands.

Quickly thereafter, sympathetic tone plummets due to injury to the descending spinal tracts that carry signals from the brainstem to the preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the lateral horn of the spinal cord (at levels T1-L2). This results in unopposed parasympathetic stimulation (carried by the intact vagus nerve), leading to hypotension and hypothermia from peripheral vasodilation and bradycardia.

A. Elevation of intracranial pressure (6%)

B. Inadequate adrenal stress response (8%)

C. Injury to descending spinal tracts (56%)

• D. Large intraperitoneal hemorrhage (26%).

• E. Rapid increase in pericardial pressure (1%)

Neurogenic shock often lasts 1-5 weeks before improving, but patients with spinal cord injury are at increased risk for hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia due to long-standing reduced sympathetic tone.

(Choice A) Elevated intracranial pressure due to a traumatic brain injury often causes CN VI palsy, papilledema, and Cushing triad (bradycardia, respiratory depression, and hypertension). This patient's hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia are more consistent with neurogenic snock.

(Choice B) A massive adrenal stress response causes hypertension and tachycardia for the ﬁrst few minutes after spinal injury. Sympathetic tone then drops precipitously due to injury to the descending sympathetic pathways, not due to an inadequate adrenal response.

(Choice D) Large intraperitoneal hemorrhage could result in hemorrhagic shock, which is generally characterized by hypotension and tachycardia (not bradycardia). This patient's suprapubic mass is most consistent with a distended bladder from bladder paralysis (rather than abdominal hemorrhage).

Acute spinal cord injury often manifests with loss of spinal cord function (eg, areﬂexia, anesthesia, paralysis, distended bladder) below the level of the lesion. Lesions that arise above T1 also often cause neurogenic shock due to interruption of the descending sympathetic ﬁbers, which results in unopposed parasympathetic stimulation of the vessels (hypotension) and heart (bradycardia). Hypothermia is also common due to a lack of peripheral vasoconstriction.

A 21-year-old man sustained a fall, hitting the left side of his head on a rock. He did not lose consciousness, but during the next 30 minutes, he developed a headache and vomited twice. The patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medication. Blood pressure is 136/90 mm Hg and pulse is 68/min. On examination, he is drowsy but otherwise well oriented.Swelling and tenderness are noted over the left frontoparietal region. CT scan of the head will most likely reveal which of the following?

Explanation

• A. Diffuse axonal injury (2%)

B. Epidural hematoma (79%)

This patient with a traumatic head injury has worsening mental status that developed over a matter of minutes. In association with the swelling over the left frontoparietal region, this presentation suggests an epidural hematoma.Epidural hematomas most commonly occur due to tearing of the middle meningeal artery, resulting in accumulation of blood between the dura matter and the skull. They often occur with fracture in the pterion region (the junction of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones) and most commonly affect young adults.

C. Intracerebral hemorrhage (2%)

• D. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (1%)

• E. Subdural hematoma (14%).

Although patients classically present with loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, only 20%-50% of patients develop this characteristic presentation and some initially remain alert. However, rapid hematoma expansion soon results in neurologic decompensation with signs of elevated intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status); symptoms typically develop within minutes to hours. CT scan of the head typically reveals a hyperdense biconvex lesion that does not cross suture lines.

(Choice A) Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) can occur from blunt force injury but typically results in immediate coma. In addition, DAl is usually diagnosed with MRI; CT scan has low sensitivity and is often normal.

(Choice C) Although an intracerebral hemorrhage causes neurologic decline, it typically occurs in older patients in the setting of severe hypertension, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or anticoagulant/antiplatelet use. It is not typically associated with trauma and would be unexpected in this young patient.

(Choice D) Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically causes a sudden, severe "thunderclap"

headache, often associated with loss of consciousness and meningismus. It usually occurs

due to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm.

(Choice E) Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common result of traumatic head injury but occurs due to tearing of the bridging veins, resulting in venous bleeding. This typically occurs in older adults and in those on antithrombotic agents. In addition, many patients develop coma from the time of onset in acute SDH, whereas chronic SDH results in the insidious onset of confusion, headache, and somnolence over a period of days to weeks.

This woman with distal extremity paresthesia, loss of vibration sense and proprioception (eg, Romberg sign), and ataxia has peripheral neuropathy. In association with anemia, skin depigmentation, fragile hair, and edema, this presentation suggests copper deﬁciency. Acquired copper deﬁciency is most often due to malabsorption from prior gastric surgery (eg, bariatric surgery). Other risk factors include chronic malabsorptive syndromes (eg, inﬂammatory bowel disease, celiac disease) and excessive ingestion of zinc, which competes with copper for absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.

bariatric surgery). Other risk factors include chronic malabsorptive synaromes (eg, inﬂammatory bowel disease, celiac disease) and excessive ingestion of zinc, which competes with copper for absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.

Copper is a required cofactor in many enzymes, including those involved with protein synthesis, cellular division, iron absorption, and normal central nervous system function. Neurologic manifestations are often the presenting symptoms and begin several years after surgery with a slowly progressive myeloneuropathy similar to subacute combined degeneration from B12 deﬁciency (eg, paresthesia, numbness, sensory ataxia). Myelopathic symptoms (eg, spasticity, upper motor neuron signs) occur in advanced disease.

B. Selenium (20%)

C. Folate (18%)

D. Vitamin C (16%)

Hematologic abnormalities are also characteristic. Microcytic anemia occurs from copper deﬁciency-induced impairment of iron absorption, although macrocytic or normocytic anemia is also common. Leukopenia may also occur. Other symptoms include hair fragility, skin depigmentation, hepatosplenomegaly, edema, and osteoporosis. The diagnosis is conﬁrmed with low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels; management includes copper supplementation and discontinuation of zinc.

(Choice B) Selenium deﬁciency causes cardiomyopathy and macrocytosis, as well as immune and thyroid dysfunction. It does not typically cause neuropathy or microcytic anemia.

(Choice C) Folate deﬁciency typically causes a megaloblastic, macrocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume > 100 um'); neurologic dysfunction and skin changes would be unexpected.

Version

(Choice D) Vitamin C deﬁciency classically causes scurvy, which is characterized by petechiae, perifollicular hemorrhage, gingivitis, bruising, and poor wound healing, none of which is seen in this patient.

Educational objective:

Copper deﬁciency typically occurs in patients with a history of gastric surgery (eg, bariatric), chronic malabsorption (eg, inﬂammatory bowel disease), or excessive zinc ingestion. Symptoms include slowly progressive myeloneuropathy similar to that of vitamin B12 deﬁciency (eg, distal extremity paresthesia, numbness, sensory ataxia), anemia, hair fragility, skin depigmentation, hepatosplenomegaly, edema, and osteoporosis.

This patient has developed impaired vision while receiving glucocorticoid eyedrops (ie, prednisolone), suggesting possible steroid-induced open-angle glaucoma (OAG). OAG is a type of optic neuropathy associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Topical glucocorticoid eyedrops and systemic glucocorticoids can raise IOP due to decreased outﬂow of aqueous humor via drainage channels in the anterior chamber, possibly worsened by the swelling of structures (eg, choroid, lens) in the posterior chamber.

OAG is characterized by insidious loss of peripheral vision related to atrophy of the optic nerve head; signs include enlargement of the optic cup and increased cup/disc ratio (ie, "cupping" of the optic disc), but this is a late ﬁnding and may not be immediately apparent. However, patients with steroid-induced OAG may also develop central blurriness early in the course due to corneal edema. Chronic use of glucocorticoids can also cause subcapsular cataracts, although this is not yet seen in this patient.

Elevated IOP in OAG can be documented with tonometry. Tonometry measures deformation of the cornea in response to applied (mechanical or pneumatic) pressure. Patients with suspected OAG should also receive assessment of peripheral ﬁelds using automated test devices (manual visual ﬁeld testing by opposition has low sensitivity for OAG).

This patient has cataracts, characterized by paciﬁcation of the lens with chronic loss of visual acuity. Patients often experience excessive glare and halos around bright lights due to scattering of light in the lens. Examination ﬁndings include visible cloudiness in the lens, decreased visualization of retinal detail, and loss of the red reﬂex.

Cataracts typically develop in patients age >60. However, they may be seen in younger patients due to diabetes mellitus, ocular trauma, glucocorticoid use, or external radiation exposure. In addition, patients with chronic HIV infection are at increased risk for cataracts, possibly due to accelerated aging or chronic immune suppression, and often develop cataracts at an early age.

• Laser iridotomy This patient has acute angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) presenting with headache, ocular pain, nausea, and decreased visual acuity. ACG is characterized by narrowing or closure of the anterior chamber angle, leading to decreased aqueous outﬂow and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Examination ﬁndings include conjunctival injection; corneal edema; palpable ﬁrmness of the eyeball; and a ﬁxed, mid-dilated pupil. The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by gonioscopy to visualize the corneal angle and/or tonometry to measure IOP.

Initial management is directed at rapidly lowering IOP. Combination therapy with multiple topical agents is recommended; a typical regimen includes timolol (which reduces aqueous production), apraclonidine (which decreases aqueous production and increases outﬂow), and pilocarpine (which causes ciliary muscle contraction to open the trabecular meshwork at the corneal angle) eye drops. In addition, oral or intravenous acetazolamide is recommended to rapidly reduce further production of aqueous humor. Subsequently, laser iridotomy can facilitate aqueous outﬂow and provide deﬁnitive management.

(Choice A) Pupillary dilation (eg, dilated funduscopic examination) narrows the corneal angle and can precipitate or worsen ACG. Therefore, mydriatic drops (eg, phenylephrine, cyclopentolate) should not be given in patients with ACG.

(Choice C) High-dose systemic glucocorticoids (eg, methy|prednisolone) are indicated for the treatment of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in giant cell (temporal) arteritis. They are also used in patients with optic neuritis (eg, due to multiple sclerosis). Although these conditions can cause various combinations of headache, ocular pain, and vision loss, this patient's conjunctival redness, mid-dilated pupil, and associated nausea are more consistent with ACG.

(Choice E) Ophthalmic zoster (which is treated with valacyclovir) presents with eye pain, conjunctivitis, and corneal ulcers.

This patient has decreased vision and signs of ocular inﬂammation/infection (eg, conjunctival chemosis [ie, edema], layering leukocytes in the anterior chamber) after recent cataract surgery. This combination of ﬁndings is consistent with postoperative endophthalmitis, a vision-threatening bacterial (or, less commonly, fungal) infection of the intraocular space that most commonly occurs within one week of surgery. Cataract surgery can cause transient contamination of the aqueous humor by conjunctival ﬂora; if inadvertent communication with the vitreous occurs during the procedure, the ﬂora can seed the vitreous, which is much more susceptible to infection.

Bacterial endophthalmitis is diagnosed clinically, and a high index of suspicion is necessary because patients typically feel well overall and are afebrile, having symptoms (eg, decreased vision, eye "ache") conﬁned to the affected eye only. Examination frequently shows

conjunctival chemosis (ie, edema) and hypopyon (ie, layering leukocytes in the anterior chamber), consistent with ocular inflammation/infection. Management requires immediate

(Choice C) Normal postoperative changes following cataract surgery may include conjunctival edema/injection or mildly blurred vision (from corneal edema). However, hypopyon and acutely decreased visual acuity are not expected and point to a complication such as endophthalmitis. (Choice E) Acute angle-closure glaucoma, whether primary (ie, due to an anatomic, narrow anterior chamber angle) or secondary (ie, due to a pathologic etiology that distorts the angle), can cause conjunctival chemosis and decreased visual acuity. However, severe eye pain, headache, and nausea/vomiting are also typically present, and corneal opacity with a ﬁxed, middilated pupil are common examination ﬁndings.

Educational objective:

Postoperative endophthalmitis is a vision-threatening condition most commonly caused by bacterial infection of the aqueous humor or vitreous. Patients usually experience decreased visual acuity, inﬂamed conjunctiva, and hypopyon. Clinical diagnosis should prompt immediate

A 30-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up after traumatic injury to his left eye. Two

Explanation

months ago, there was an explosion at the factory where he worked. A large piece of shrapnel penetrated his left eye. Surgical removal of the shrapnel was performed, and vision in the left eye recovered to 20/200. Today, the patient reports that vision in his right eye is becoming blurry. On examination, there is bilateral conjunctival erythema. The right eye visual acuity is 20/160, which was normal 2 months ago. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's current ocular condition?

This patient with a traumatic injury to the left eye has developed inﬂammation (eg, conjunctival erythema) and decreased vision in the uninjured right eye. This is most consistent with

sympathetic ophthalmia, an autoimmune condition that can occur when T cells become sensitized to previously sequestered eye antigens.

• A. Hematogenous fungal spread (7%).

• B. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity (6%)

• C. Narrow anterior chamber angle (17%)

• D. Precipitating immune complexes (17%)

• E. T-cell sensitization to self-antigens (50%)

Omitted

Certain anatomic sites (eg, eyes, testes) have inherent immune privilege, in which inﬂammation is inhibited to limit potential organ damage. However, if self-antigens from these sites are released through trauma into the lymphatic system, T cells may recognize these antigens as foreign and mount an inﬂammatory response against both the injured eye and the uninjured eye. Introduction of bacteria during trauma may also upregulate the inﬂammatory process, increasing the chances that these autoreactive T cells will develop.

Correct answer

50%

Answered correctly

The potential for sympathetic ophthalmia is considered in the management of severe eye injuries. If an injured eye has no expected recovery of vision, it is surgically removed (ie, enucleated) to prevent blindness in the uninjured eye. However, if some recovery is anticipated (as occurred in this patient), close follow-up is performed. If the condition develops, treatment focuses on decreasing inﬂammation (eg, corticosteroids, monoclonal biologics).

(Choice A) Hematogenous fungal spread can cause fungal endophthalmitis resulting in eye pain and progressive vision loss. However, it is unlikely in the absence of risk factors (eg, intravenous drug use, indwelling catheter) or current symptoms/signs of fungemia.

(Choice B) Allergic conjunctivitis is caused by an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity response. Although it can cause conjunctival erythema, it also typically causes signiﬁcant itching. In addition, it does not usually cause vision loss.

(Choice C) A narrow anterior chamber angle can predispose to acute angle-closure glaucoma, which can cause decreased visual acuity and conjunctival injection. However, it also typically

causes ocular pain, headache, and nausea, and examination usually reveals palpable ﬁrmness of the eyeball and a ﬁxed, mid-dilated pupil.

(Choice D) Immune complex deposition due to systemic disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) can lead to occlusive vasculitis of the retina and visual loss. However, other symptoms of autoimmune disease are typically present, and this patient's history of ocular trauma makes sympathetic ophthalmia more likely.

Educational objective:

Traumatic injury to the eye can lead to the release of previously sequestered self-antigens that T cells recognize as foreign. This can lead to inﬂammation and blindness in both the injured and uninjured eye.

• Inadequate examination (eg, severe soft tissue swelling, altered mental status) This patient sustained blunt trauma to the eye that has resulted in periorbital bruising/edema and subconjunctival hemorrhage. On examination, he has no obvious signs of hyphema (eg, blood layering within the anterior chamber) or globe rupture (eg, irregularly shaped pupil). However, he has pain with extraocular movement and decreased visual acuity in the affected eye. These ﬁndings raise concern for other serious orbital injury and warrant further work-up with CT scan.

Version

CT scan of the orbits and facial bones can diagnose orbital injuries, such as orbital fracture or early retrobulbar hemorrhage, that are not obvious on examination. The early symptoms of such injuries may be subtle, such as pain with testing of extraocular movements (due to the irritation of the extraocular muscles) or minor changes in visual acuity. In addition, associated examination ﬁndings-such as enophthalmos (posterior globe displacement; eg, from orbital blowout fracture) or proptosis (eg, from retrobulbar hemorrhage) —may be absent, especially early after injury, or they may be difﬁcult to appreciate due to surrounding soft tissue swelling. Early detection of orbital injury with CT scan can prevent delay in treatment that might lead to vision-threatening complications. These complications may include acute progression of retrobulbar hemorrhage to orbital compartment syndrome or long-term enophthalmos, diplopia, and cosmetic deformity if orbital fracture is not recognized and treated appropriately (eg, with surgical ﬁxation).

(Choice A) Admission for observation with head of bed elevation is used in the treatment of hyphema, which typically presents with blood layering within the anterior chamber (not present in this patient). This patient's painful eye movement is more concerning for an injury involving the orbit or extraocular muscles, for which a CT scan should be obtained.

(Choices B and C) Discharging the patient with analgesics is appropriate for isolated soft tissue contusion; topical antibiotics may be added if a corneal abrasion is present. Neither of these conditions typically cause pain with extraocular movement; therefore, a CT scan should be performed to search for a cause (eg, orbital fracture) of this ﬁnding. Tight patching is sometimes used for pain control for large corneal abrasions but is not indicated in this patient.

Educational objective:

Blunt eye trauma can cause serious orbital injuries such orbital fracture and retrobulbar hemorrhage. The early symptoms of such injuries may be subtle (eg, pain with eye movement, minor change in visual acuity) but still warrant a CT scan to make the diagnosis and avoid potentially vision-threatening complications.

*Associated with high myopia (ie, 26 diopters of correction).

This patient has progressive myopia (nearsightedness), a refractive error most commonly caused by increased anterior-posterior diameter of the eye. As the axial length of the eye increases during adolescence, the risk of myopia also increases because the focal point of a refracted image shifts anterior to the retina. The image displacement causes blurred distance vision, although vision of nearby objects is normal. Examination shows decreased visual acuity; peripheral ﬁeld testing and funduscopic examination are normal. Management of

myopia is with prescription lenses with a diverging (concave) lens, which refocuses the

refracted image onto the retina.

Patients with progressive myopia (ie, untreated or refractory to treatment) may develop high myopia, which is characterized by needing ≥6 diopters of correction to achieve normal visual acuity, as seen in this patient. High myopia leads to stretching and thinning of the sclera, choroid, and retina. These mechanical changes are associated with an increased risk of retinal detachment and macular degeneration, both of which can lead to vision loss. Retinal

Patients with progressive myopia (ie, untreated or refractory to treatment) may develop high myopia, which is characterized by needing ≥6 diopters of correction to achieve normal visual acuity, as seen in this patient. High myopia leads to stretching and thinning of the sclera, choroid, and retina. These mechanical changes are associated with an increased risk of retinal detachment and macular degeneration, both of which can lead to vision loss. Retinal detachment in high myopia is characterized by a retinal tear that allows vitreous ﬂuid to accumulate between the retinal layers.

In some children, antimuscarinic drops (eg, atropine) or orthokeratology (ie, rigid contact lens) may be used to slow progressive myopia and prevent subsequent complications.

(Choice B) Anterior uveitis (intraocular inﬂammation) can cause eye pain, redness, and vision loss. Associated conditions include infection (eg, herpes viruses) and autoimmune disease (juvenile idiopathic arthritis). The incidence is not increased with myopia.

(Choice C) Pterygium is a wedge-shaped proliferation of conjunctival tissue that expands from the lateral aspects of the eye toward the cornea. Patients typically have chronic ultraviolet light exposure; myopia is not associated with pterygium development.

(Choice E) Retinal microinfarctions are characterized by arteriolar obstruction leading to ischemia and are seen on funduscopy as yellow-white retinal lesions (cotton-wool spots). This condition is associated with hypertension and diabetes, not high myopia.

Educational objective:

Myopia, or nearsightedness, is characterized by increased anterior-posterior diameter of the eye, causing blurred distance vision. High myopia (≥6 diopters of correction) increases the risk of retinal detachment and macular degeneration.

• A. Analgesics, replacement of contact lenses, and reassurance (30%)

This patient has a corneal abrasion, a defect in the corneal epithelium that usually results

from minor trauma. In contact lens users, corneal abrasion is typically caused by overworn, improperly ﬁtted, or contaminated lenses. In addition to experiencing pain, tearing, and photophobia, patients often have a foreign body sensation in the eye. The diagnosis is conﬁrmed with ﬂuorescein staining and visualization of the eye using a Wood lamp or the cobalt blue ﬁlter of a slit lamp. Fluorescein stains corneal basement membrane but not intact corneal epithelium; therefore, if a corneal epithelial defect (eg, abrasion) is present, its size, shape, and location can be diagnosed by the demarcated area of ﬂuorescein uptake.

Correct answer

To prevent superinfection with bacteria and ensure proper healing, corneal abrasions are treated with topical antibiotics and close follow-up with ophthalmology. In patients who use contact lenses (such as this patient), antipseudomonal coverage is required, typically with topical ﬂuoroquinolones (eg, ciproﬂoxacin). Eye patching is usually not recommended because it can abrade the cornea further and increase risk of infection (Choice C). Without appropriate treatment, corneal abrasion can progress to corneal ulceration, a vision-threatening condition.

(Choice A) Analgesics (eg, oral or topical nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs) are appropriate for patients with corneal abrasion. However, abrasions in contact lens users should also be treated with topical antibiotics due to the increased risk of infection (especially pseudomonal infection). Contact lens use should be discontinued until the corneal abrasion is

fully healed.

(Choice B) CT scan of the orbits is used when open globe injury, orbital fracture, or an intraocular foreign body is suspected.

A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to a burning sensation in her left eye. Her symptoms began yesterday after she put in her contact lenses, and they have been worsening despite her removing the contact lenses and using saline drops. The patient has also had excessive tearing and photophobia.She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Vital signs are normal. The patient appears uncomfortable and keeps her left eye closed. On examination of the left eye, the conjunctiva is erythematous and injected; the anterior chamber is clear. The pupils are round and reactive to light, and extraocular movements are intact bilaterally. The left eye is stained with ﬂuorescein and inspected using a cobalt blue ﬁltered light; a single, small oval area of green uptake is present at the 7 o'clock position of the cornea. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

• A. Analgesics, replacement of contact lenses, and reassurance (30%).

To prevent superinfection with bacteria and ensure proper healing, corneal abrasions are treated with topical antibiotics and close follow-up with ophthalmology. In patients who use contact lenses (such as this patient), antipseudomonal coverage is required, typically with topical ﬂuoroquinolones (eg, ciproﬂoxacin). Eye patching is usually not recommended because it can abrade the cornea further and increase risk of infection (Choice C). Without appropriate treatment, corneal abrasion can progress to corneal ulceration, a vision-threatening

condition.

(Choice A) Analgesics (eg, oral or topical nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs) are appropriate for patients with corneal abrasion. However, abrasions in contact lens users should also be treated with topical antibiotics due to the increased risk of infection (especially pseudomonal infection). Contact lens use should be discontinued until the corneal abrasion is fully healed.

This patient had a high-velocity projectile injury to the eye; however, the object is not identiﬁed on inspection, raising the possibility of open globe laceration (OGL) with an intraocular foreign body. OGL is typically caused by small, high-velocity particles (eg, metal shards) sent airborne by power tools, explosions (including weapons), lawn mowers, or motor vehicle accidents. Penetration of the globe most commonly occurs at the cornea.

Large OGL may present with globe deformity, extrusion of vitreous or iris, or a visible entry wound. In the absence of an obvious wound, OGL may be inferred by a peaked or teardrop

pupil (iris stretching due to the laceration or foreign object), increased or decreased anterior

chamber depth, or reduced intraocular pressure. Other potential manifestations include loss of visual acuity or absent afferent pupillary response. If OGL is suspected but not obvious on examination, further assessment should be performed with ﬂuorescein drops; as aqueous drains through the puncture site, ﬂuorescein may be seen streaming away from the site or clear ﬂuid may be seen ﬂowing through the ﬂuorescein.

(Choices C and D) Hypopyon is a layering of inﬂammatory cells in the dependent portion of the anterior chamber. Perilimbal injection (also called ciliary ﬂush) is characterized by dilation of the vasculature at the junction of the sclera and cornea. These ﬁndings are seen in a variety of inﬂammatory (eg, anterior uveitis/iritis) and infectious (eg, endophthalmitis, keratitis) conditions. Although OGL can lead to endophthalmitis, these ﬁndings would not be present at the time of initial presentation.

(Choice E) Periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes) suggests orbital/skull fracture. Orbital fracture with globe rupture typically occurs with blunt trauma.

Educational objective:

Open globe laceration (OGL) is typically caused by small, high-velocity particles sent airborne by power tools, explosions, lawn mowers, or motor vehicle accidents. Large OGL may present with globe deformity, extrusion of vitreous or iris, or a visible entry wound.

Management • Emergency surgical decompression This patient's eye ﬁndings are consistent with orbital compartment syndrome (OCS), a rare ophthalmologic emergency that can lead to permanent vision loss. OCS occurs when swelling and/or hemorrhage within the conﬁned orbital space causes rapidly increasing intraorbital pressure and subsequent ischemia of the optic nerve and globe. Eye trauma, as in this patient, is the most common precipitating event; however, underlying coagulopathy, orbital infection, and recent periocular surgery are also risk factors.

OCS presents with acute eye pain and vision loss. Examination shows a tight orbit characterized by a rock-hard eyelid, periorbital edema, proptosis, and resistance to retropulsion (ie, pushing on the eye). Optic nerve injury can cause a relative afferent pupillary defect, in which both pupils dilate in response to a swinging ﬂashlight shining light from the normal to the affected eye; eye movements may be impaired due to extraocular muscle compression. Diffuse subconjunctival hemorrhage and periorbital ecchymoses are also common, particularly with posttraumatic OCS.

OCS is diagnosed clinically and is an ophthalmologic emergency requiring immediate orbital decompression. Orbital decompression is accomplished by cutting the eyelid tissue

(Choice A) Cool compresses and nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen) are used to treat an isolated periorbital hematoma, which typically presents after trauma with pain and bruising around the eye. Decreased visual acuity, an afferent pupillary defect, and proptosis would not be seen.

Version

(Choices C and E) Detailed ophthalmologic evaluation with dilated funduscopic examination and tonometry should not precede emergency decompression for OCS due to increased morbidity with delayed decompression. In addition, serial tonometry is not typically required for OCS because intraocular pressure should normalize after surgery.

Educational objective:

Orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) causes eye pain and vision loss due to rapidly increased intraorbital pressure.Examination shows a tight orbit (eg, periorbital swelling, hard eyelid, proptosis) and a relative afferent pupillary defect. OCS is a clinical diagnosis and requires immediate orbital decompression to prevent permanent vision loss.

Floaters and progressive loss of vision develop ﬁrst; eye pain occurs late in the disease course. Systemic symptoms (eg, fever) often occur when fungemia is present.

Although central catheters are usually the portal of entry, the catheter insertion site often appears normal (eg, no pus or erythema). In the presence of suggestive fundoscopic ﬁndings, blood cultures and, in some cases, vitreous ﬂuid sampling can be used for diagnosis. Systemic antifungals (eg, ﬂuconazole) and vitreous antifungal injection/vitrectomy (when the vitreous is involved) are the mainstays of treatment.

•version

Venom from North American snakes contains toxins that can cause local tissue toxicity (eg, swelling), coagulation abnormalities (eg, oozing, ecchymosis), neuro/myotoxicity, and cardiovascular collapse (eg, hypotension, delayed capillary reﬁll). Some effects may be delayed by several hours. Complete blood count, creatine kinase, prothrombin/partial thromboplastin time, INR, and ﬁbrinogen should be obtained. Frequent wound examinations should assess for swelling, ecchymosis, and symptom progression. A decision should be made regarding antivenom administration.

There are 2 types of antivenom for North American snake bites: Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (ovine), brand name CroFab (FabAV), which can be used for all North American snake bites, and Crotalidae Immune F(ab'), (equine), brand name Anavip (Fab2AV). which can be

• • A. Administer Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (61%)

There are 2 types of antivenom for North American snake bites: Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (ovine), brand name CroFab (FabAV), which can be used for all North American snake bites, and Crotalidae Immune F(ab')2 (equine), brand name Anavip (Fab2AV), which can be used only for conﬁrmed rattlesnake bites. Treatment with either carries a risk of anaphylaxis and should be done in consultation with a toxicologist or snake bite expert.

• Given the risk of anaphylaxis, patients with mild envenomation (eg, mild, localized swelling; normal laboratory studies) should not receive antivenom but should be observed for 12-24 hours because delayed toxicity can occur.

(Choice B) Prophylactic antibiotics are sometimes indicated in animal and human bites, deep puncture wounds, or bites to high-risk areas (eg, hands). Infections related to snake bites are uncommon, and prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

(Choice C) Snake bites can cause symptoms mimicking compartment syndrome (eg, pronounced swelling, pain with passive movement, decreased capillary reﬁll). However, most swelling occurs outside the muscular compartment and does not affect intracompartmental perfusion pressure. Fasciotomies should involve expert consultation and should not proceed without intracompartmental pressure measurement.

(Choices D and E) Tourniquets or pressure immobilization techniques are not recommended because they trap the venom in the involved extremity and can potentially cause ischemia. Suctioning (eg, local suction devices) only minimally reduces total body venom amount and may actually increase venom absorption by causing local tissue damage. Although these techniques were previously used, they should be avoided.

Educational objective:

Venomous snake bites should be managed with close observation and frequent coagulation studies and wound evaluations. Patients with mild envenomation and normal laboratory studies can be observed for 12-24 hours. Patients with abnormal laboratory results, progressing symptoms, or signs of systemic toxicity should receive antivenom.

Explanation

was maneuvering an extended ladder when it contacted an overhead power line. The patient is alert and cooperative but has no recollection of the accident. Temperature is 37.8 C (100 F), blood pressure is 124/80 mm Hg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination reveals that bilateral hands are charred, leathery, and insensate, and large, open wounds are present on the soles of both feet. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm. Based on these ﬁndings, the patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following complications over the next several days?

This patient whose ladder contacted an overhead power line became part of the pathway for electricity traveling from the power line to the ground, likely entering his hands (eg, charred, insensate hands) and exiting his feet (eg, large, open wounds on his soles).

C. Rhabdomyolysis (87%)

• D. Seizures (8%)

• E. Thrombocytosis (1%).

In patients with high-voltage electrical injuries, tissue damage occurs from both the direct injury caused by electricity and from the secondary conversion of electrical energy to thermal energy. Because bone (with its high resistance to electrical current) generates the most heat as current passes through the body, thermal injury to internal tissues surrounding the bone (eg, skeletal muscle) often exceeds the visible injury to external tissues (eg, skin). Skeletal muscle necrosis in patients with high-voltage electrical injuries often leads to the following clinical features:

• Acute compartment syndrome from intracompartmental muscle swelling

A 55-year-old electrician comes to the emergency department due to a wound to his right leg

Explanation

that started 3 days ago. After crawling through an attic laying electrical wire, he developed a stabbing pain and burning sensation in his right thigh. The patient noticed a small, red area on his posterior right thigh, with 2 small dots in the middle. He thinks he was bitten by one of the small, brown spiders he saw in the attic. The pain lasted a few hours and then subsided.Several hours later a blister formed. Over the next 2 days, a black area appeared in place of the blister and has expanded toward his feet. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. On examination, the patient is awake and alert, and nontoxic in appearance. He has a 2-cm, dry eschar on his posterior right thigh. There is a surrounding outer ring of erythema. No signiﬁcant swelling or ﬂuctuance is present. He has normal pulses distal to the wound. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Bites from Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse)

• Southwestern, southern, midwestern United States Epidemiology • Dry, warm areas (eg, attics, basements)

• Spider identiﬁcation rare (initial bite usually painless)

• Small erythematous papule that self-resolves (most common)

• Burning pain → blister → eschar/necrosis Manifestations • Expands over days, heals over weeks

• Systemic loxoscelism (eg, fever, hemolysis, DIC)

• Uncommon; not correlated with lesion size

• A. Administer a corticosteroid injection (5%)

• B. Prescribe hyperbaric oxygen therapy (10%)

• C. Prescribe oral antistaphylococcal antibiotic (13%)

• Cleanse wound & apply ice (reduces phospholipase activity) • No surgical débridement until lesion has stopped growing Management

• Supportive management for systemic loxoscelism

This patient has a classic presentation of a Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse) spider bite. L reclusa spiders, common in the United States, are found in warm, dry areas (eg, attics, woodpiles, cellars). Although their bites can be painful, they are often initially painless, so spider identiﬁcation rarely occurs. Burning pain due to local ischemia can start a few hours after the bite and become severe. A small, red papule appears ﬁrst and often heals in days to weeks without intervention. In severe cases, blister formation occurs in the ﬁrst 24 hours with a blueish discoloration; the area becomes necrotic (10% of bites) and expands in size over the next week, usually in a gravity-dependent manner.

Initial treatment involves local wound care and pain control. The site should be cleaned and cold compresses applied. The activity of venom phospholipases, believed to be responsible for most local tissue necrosis, is decreased by cold therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs or opioids should be used for pain management. Most cases resolve with these measures.

The only proven therapy is antivenom (not approved for use in the United States). Other researched therapies (eg, dapsone, tetracycline, glucocorticoids, hyperbaric oxygen) have not demonstrated a conclusive beneﬁt. In some cases, surgical wound débridement can be helpful once the necrosis has stopped advancing; however, if performed too early, this procedure may cause increased pain and wound breakdown.

This patient with severe burns now has persistent fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. In the absence of infection (eg, negative blood and wound cultures), the most likely cause is a hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury.

2023

E: Version

The severity of the hypermetabolic response increases proportionally with burn size. It typically arises within the ﬁrst 5 days postinjury, after an initial 24-48 hours of shock (eg, increased capillary permeability, myocardial depression). It is likely triggered by the profound release of inﬂammatory mediators from damaged tissue, leading to increased levels of catecholamines and glucocorticoids, with the following clinical features:

• Tachycardia and hypertension due to a hyperdynamic circulatory response

• Hyperglycemia due to increased gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance

A 25-year-old woman comes to the ofﬁce due to a small ulcer on the right upper thigh. She went camping yesterday and while she was putting her pants on she suddenly had a feeling of being bitten over her right upper thigh. She ignored it, but the pain has been increasing. She has had no abdominal pain or difﬁculty breathing. The patient has no medical problems and takes no medications. Temperature is 36.8 C (98.2 F), blood pressure is 116/72 mm Hg, and pulse is 74/min.Physical examination shows an erythematous and painful ulcer on the

lateral aspect of the right upper thigh; the remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Which of the following complications is most likely to develop in this patient over the next

few days?

Explanation

This patient's clinical presentation, with a small ulcer developing at the site of a recent bite, is highly suggestive of a brown recluse spider bite. Such bites commonly occur as patients are putting their clothes on. They are often painless and may initially go unrecognized, but some bites are painful or cause a burning sensation. Many cases result in a small papule that heals in days to weeks. However, in some cases, a deep skin ulcer develops at the bite site over the course of a few days, with an erythematous halo and a necrotic center that can progress to an

eschar.

• A. Abdominal rigidity and muscle cramps (8%)

• B. Arthritis, arrhythmias, and facial palsy (18%).

• C. Hemoglobinuria and bleeding (3%)

• D. Muscle paralysis (6%).

With basic wound management, the lesion often heals without scarring.Debridement should be avoided in the early stages of necrosis but may facilitate healing once the lesion is stable and well-demarcated; severe cases may require skin grafting.

• • E. Necrosis and eschar (64%).

(Choice A) By contrast to brown recluse spider bites, black widow spider bites often lead to more pronounced local and systemic manifestations due to effects of the toxin. These include muscle pain (a prominent ﬁnding), abdominal rigidity (sometimes mimicking a surgical abdomen), and muscle cramps (seen in >60% of patients). Wound ulceration is uncommon, and patients commonly develop nausea and vomiting within hours of the bite, making this an unlikely diagnosis in this patient.

(Choice B) Arthritis, arrhythmias, and facial palsy can occur as late complications of Lyme disease; these typically do not develop until months after the tick bite. The initial rash, erythema migrans, is classically a target lesion with central clearing (not ulceration) at the site of tick bite. The tick must remain attached for ~48 hours before transmission occurs.

(Choices C and D) Hemoglobinuria, bleeding, and muscle paralysis may be seen with snakebites, which would cause severe local pain, swelling, and discoloration within hours of the

bite.

Educational objective:

Brown recluse spider bites can cause a deep necrotic ulcer at the bite site. The ulcer can progress over days to an eschar.

Full-thickness burns, which injure the entire epidermis and dermis, result in leathery, noncompliant eschars. When circumferential, these eschars can form constrictive bands around affected body parts (eg, left arm). Simultaneously, aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation and increased capillary permeability from the postburn inﬂammatory response can cause signiﬁcant soft tissue edema. In the setting of this soft tissue swelling, the constrictive eschar band can act as a tourniquet, resulting in vascular compromise, ﬁrst of the venous and then the arterial circulation.

This patient with full-thickness burns of the left arm has developed severe pain and tenseness (ie, swelling) of the limb with evidence of compromised perfusion (eg, diminished radial pulse).

This patient with full-thickness burns of the left arm has developed severe pain and tenseness (ie, swelling) of the limb with evidence of compromised perfusion (eg, diminished radial pulse). To restore perfusion, escharotomy should be performed immediately by creating an incision through the burned skin until subcutaneous fat is observed and skin tension is released. Escharotomy releases the tourniquet effect of the circumferential, constrictive eschar band and typically restores distal circulation. Often, multiple escharotomies (eg, medial, lateral) are necessdry.

(Choice A) Rhabdomyolysis (diagnosed by elevated creatine kinase levels in the thousands) can lead to muscle swelling within an enclosed fascial compartment and subsequent compartment syndrome with vascular compromise (eg, diminished radial pulse). However, this is more typically seen with electrical (vs thermal) burns in which the electrical current causes direct muscle injury. This patient's limb ischemia is more likely due to circumferential, constrictive eschar.

(Choices B and C) Empiric intravenous heparin infusion and CT angiography are indicated in patients with suspected arterial thrombosis or embolism. Although these can also cause painful limb ischemia, this patient's ischemia is more likely caused by a constrictive eschar, given her tense extremity with circumferential full-thickness burns and lack of typical thrombotic/embolic risk factors (eg, atherosclerosis, atrial ﬁbrillation).

perfusion. Educational objective:

Circumferential, full-thickness burns can result in the formation of constrictive eschar bands. When profound edema from aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation and increased capillary permeability occur together, vascular compromise can result. Immediate release of the burned skin (ie, escharotomy) is required to restore perfusion.

A 19-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 34 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital for preeclampsia with severe features. She has no chronic medical conditions and takes no mee cations. On admission, temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 170/110 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. While administering the magnesium sulfate bolus, the fetal heart rate becomes persistently bradycardic to the 90s.The patient is rushed to the operating room for an emergency cesarean delivery and undergoes general anesthesia. Immediately after intubation, intraoperative temperature is 39.4 C (102.9 F), blood pressure is 180/110 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min, and respiratory rate is 30/min. The patient is markedly rigid and increasingly difﬁcult to ventilate. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's acute decompensation?

Explanation

Malignant hyperthermia

• Genetic mutation alters control of intracellular calcium

Epidemiology

• Triggered by volatile anesthetics, succinylcholine, excessive heat

• Masseter muscle/generalized rigidity

• Sinus tachycardia

• Hypercarbia resistant to increased minute ventilation

Manifestations

• Rhabdomyolysis

• A. Amniotic ﬂuid embolism (1%)

• B. Eclamptic seizure (3%)

• C. Magnesium sulfate toxicity (4%)

• D. Malignant hyperthermia (83%)

• Hyperkalemia

• Hyperthermia (late manifestation)

• Respiratory/ventilatory support

Treatment

• Immediate cessation of causative anesthetic

• Dantrolene

• E. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (6%).

This patient with preeclampsia with severe features was being managed appropriately (eg, magnesium sulfate) but developed fetal bradycardia requiring emergency cesarean delivery. Her acute decompensation following anesthetic induction is most likely due to malignant hyperthermia (MH), a rare but life-threatening condition likely due to a skeletal muscle receptor anomaly that results in excessive intracellular calcium accumulation upon anesthesia exposure (eg, anesthesia induction).

As a result of the calcium accumulation, patients with MH develop sudden-onset muscle rigidity (ie, prolonged muscle contraction) and resultant muscle hypermetabolism (eg, fever, tachycardia). In addition, MH causes hypercarbia and tachypnea (due to increased cellular metabolism), difﬁculty ventilating, and rhabdomyolysis (eg, myoglobinuria). Management is immediate cessation of the anesthetic, administration of dantrolene (a skeletal muscle relaxant), and supportive care (in addition to completing the emergency delivery as quickly and as safely as possible in this patient).

(Choice A) Amniotic ﬂuid embolism (AFE) typically presents postpartum as acute cardiac or respiratory collapse and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, possibly due to anaphylaxis

The patient is rushed to the operating room for an emergency cesarean delivery and undergoes general anesthesia. Immediately after intubation, intraoperative temperature is 39.4 C (102.9 F), blood pressure is 180/110 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min, and respiratory rate is 30/min. The patient is markedly rigid and increasingly difﬁcult to ventilate. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's acute decompensation?

Management is immediate cessation of the anesthetic, administration of dantrolene (a skeletal muscle relaxant), and supportive care (in addition to completing the emergency delivery as quickly and as safely as possible in this patient).

(Choice A) Amniotic ﬂuid embolism (AFE) typically presents postpartum as acute cardiac or respiratory collapse and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, possibly due to anaphylaxis from amniotic ﬂuid entering maternal circulation. In contrast to this patient, AFE causes profound hypotension (systolic <90 mm Hg).

• A. Amniotic ﬂuid embolism (1%)

• B. Eclamptic seizure (3%)

• C. Magnesium sulfate toxicity (4%)

•• D. Malignant hyperthermia (83%)

(Choice B) Eclamptic seizures can occur in patients with preeclampsia with severe features. Although this patient has severe-range blood pressures (eg, systolic ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic ≥110 mm Hg), she has received magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. In addition, eclampsia does not cause fever or tachypnea, making this diagnosis less likely.

• E. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (6%)

(Choice C) Magnesium sulfate is used for seizure prophylaxis in patients with preeclampsia, likely via membrane stabilization that raises the seizure threshold. Toxic doses can affect both skeletal muscle (decreased acetylcholine release) and cardiac muscle (prolonged conduction time); therefore, patients can develop marked muscle weakness, loss of deep tendon reﬂexes, respiratory depression (rather than tachypnea), and cardiac arrest.

(Choice E) Although neuroleptic malignant syndrome has a similar presentation to MH (eg, fever, muscle rigidity), it is triggered by neuroleptic agents (eg, haloperidol, promethazine) rather than anesthetics. In addition, neuroleptic malignant syndrome develops over the course of days, not minutes.

Educational objective:

Malignant hyperthermia is a rare, life-threatening condition that presents after anesthetic induction with sudden-onset fever, tachycardia, tachypnea (eg, difﬁculty ventilating), and muscle rigidity. Treatment is immediate cessation of the anesthetic and administration of dantrolene.

Preoperative hemoglobin was 12.1 g/dL and a repeat this morning was 9.9 g/dL. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient's condition?

This postoperative patient with weakened dorsiﬂexion (ie, footdrop) and decreased sensation of the right big toe has common ﬁbular (ie, peroneal) nerve injury. Additional signs of injury may include decreased sensation of the lateral shin and decreased great toe extension.

The common ﬁbular nerve is at risk for injury during gynecologic surgery because of its course around the lateral aspect of the ﬁbular head (where there is little soft tissue), making it susceptible to a compressive injury. The nerve is vulnerable when patients are placed in a dorsal lithotomy position with stirrup boots for vaginal surgery (as in this patient). This particularly occurs when there is improper patient placement because excessive external hip rotation and limited padding cause increased lateral force at the ﬁbular head in the stirrup boot. The compressive injury is exacerbated in obese patients or those with prolonged operative times (>4 hr).

• A. Exploratory laparotomy (10%)

• B. Immobilization and serial physical examinations (5%)

• C. Lumbosacral MRI (34%).

• D. Midurethral sling removal (2%).

Because the compressive injury is acute and temporary (rather than a transection or infarction), it is usually transient and resolves fully within a matter of weeks. Therefore, treatment is usually supportive with reassurance, physical therapy, and continued mobilization.

(Choice A) Pelvic hematomas can occasionally develop with gynecologic surgery and cause compression of the femoral nerve in the retroperitoneal space. Patients with pelvic hematomas can have a decreasing hemoglobin concentration; however, they usually have increasing pelvic pain. Those with hematomas large enough to cause a femoral neuropathy have a decreased patellar reﬂex, impaired hip ﬂexion and knee extension, and anterior thigh sensory loss. This patient has an appropriate drop in hemoglobin and signs of a peroneal nerve injury; therefore, exploratory laparotomy is not indicated.

(Choice B) Postoperative compressive peripheral neuropathy is best treated with continued movement and mobilization of the affected limb. Prolonged immobilization can delay recovery. (Choice C) A lumbosacral MRI is indicated for patients with clinical signs of a proximal nerve root injury (radiculopathy) that affects ≥1 nerve roots. This patient's lack of hip or knee dysfunction and normal patellar reﬂex suggest a more distal nerve injury.

(Choice D) Midurethral sling placement can potentially cause an ilioinguinal nerve entrapment, which leads to sharp burning pain radiating to the suprapubic area, or urinary retention (from compression of the urethra). In these cases, sling removal is necessary.

A 37-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her boyfriend for severe abdominal pain that started several hours ago. The pain started diffusely in the periumbilical area but is now mostly localized to the lower abdomen. The patient has persistent nausea but no vomiting. Her last menstrual period was 25 days ago, but she has irregular periods. She is sexually active with her boyfriend. Her temperature is 36.8 C (98.1 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm g, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 25/min. The abdomen, especially in the lower quadrants, is tender on palpation with mild guarding. There is no shifting dullness. Bowel sounds are diminished. Laboratory results are as

follows:

Hemoglobin

13.1 g/dL

Hematocrit 43% White blood cells 10,900/pL Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?

Explanation

This patient has acute-onset abdominal pain with a variety of possible etiologies, including gastrointestinal (Gl) (eg, peptic ulcer disease, appendicitis, bowel obstruction or perforation), genitourinary (eg, kidney stone, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, pelvic inﬂammatory disease), vascular (eg, bowel ischemia), and musculoskeletal. Her last menses was 25 days ago, and she is sexually active with her boyfriend. She needs further evaluation to differentiate these etiologies, which may require imaging.

• A. Abdominal CT scan (4%)

• B. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (0%).

• C. Pelvic ultrasound (10%)

• D. Pregnancy test (84%)

• E. Upright chest x-ray (0%)

A pregnancy test should be performed ﬁrst as early pregnancy can present with Gl symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, and constipation. In addition, pregnancy should be excluded before exposing this patient to any tests involving radiation (eg, x-ray, CT scan). An embryo exposed to ionizing radiation during the ﬁrst 14 days after conception may survive undamaged, but is often severely injured and subsequently resorbed. Further, exposure after the ﬁrst 14 days frequently leads to developmental defects. A serum quantitative pregnancy test is very sensitive, and can be positive within 4 days of implantation; the urine pregnancy test can be negative for a week before becoming positive. If the pregnancy test is positive, this patient will require a pelvic ultrasound (Choice C) to evaluate for an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic ultrasound can also be helpful for evaluating ovarian pathology. If the pregnancy test is negative, abdominal CT can be considered to evaluate possible appendicitis or kidney stones (Choice A). Abdominal x-ray (Choice E) may also then be considered to rule out intestinal obstruction or perforation (free air under the

diaphragm).

A 19-year-old college student comes to the emergency department due to a 1-week history of malaise, fever, and a painful right knee that he says, "I probably just hurt playing football." He has no other symptoms and reports that he has been studying hard and looking forward to an upcoming football game. The patient has a history of depression that is currently treated with ﬂuoxetine. His family history is signiﬁcant for diabetes mellitus in his father. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 12/min. Physical examination shows a swollen, hot right knee joint that is tender to palpation with a restricted range of motion. The patient is informed about the need for a joint aspiration for possible septic arthritis but refuses, saying, "I prefer not to have anything done with needles; I'll take pain medication and just get some rest." The physician counsels him about the risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives to the aspiration and explains that he can be given a local anesthetic to numb the pain. The patient reports understanding the information but continues to refuse the procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

• A. Admit the patient to the hospital involuntarily as untreated septic arthritis is potentially life-threatening

• B. Allow the patient to leave, but counsel him that he can return at any time

• C. Allow the patient to leave but inform his coach that he should not play football

• D. Obtain a psychiatry consult to assess the patient's depression and his capacity to refuse treatment

• E. Tell the patient that his parents must be informed because he is refusing a necessary procedure

A 75-year-old hospitalized woman with a history of Alzheimer dementia is evaluated due to labile blood pressure and worsening agitation. The patient was admitted 4 days ago for right hip replacement after a traumatic fall and hip fracture. Her immediate postoperative course was complicated by agitation, and she was treated with haloperidol. Despite treatment, the patient continues to be agitated and confused. Today, her systolic blood pressure has measured between 120 and 170 mm Hg.. Temperature is 38.7 C (101.6 F), pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 22/min. Pulse oximetry is 97% on room air. On mental status examination, the patient is not oriented to place or person. She is drooling and diaphoretic. Heart and lungs are normal. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The operative site is clean and dry. Muscle tone is increased in both the upper and the lower extremities. Tremor is present. Deep tendon reﬂexes are 2+. Babinski sign is absent. Laboratory results are as follows:

Red blood cells 1-2/hpf

(Choice A) In malignant hyperthermia (MH), exposure to certain anesthetic agents (eg, succinylcholine, inhalational gasses) causes a hypermetabolic crisis with sustained muscle contraction that leads to tachypnea, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and myoglobinuria. However, most cases arise during or shortly after induction of anesthesia and are associated with high mortality within 24 hours if untreated (eg, with dantrolene); this makes MH an unlikely explanation for this patient's symptoms persisting 4 days postoperatively.

• B. Excessive catecholamine production by a tumor (3%)

• C. Decreased central dopaminergic activity (37%)

• D. Infection-induced hyperarousal (27%)

(Choice B) Excessive catecholamine-producing tumors (eg, pheochromocytomas) can cause resistant hypertension with tachycardia. Surgical removal can precipitate catecholamine surges and result in labile blood pressures, high fever, and fatal arrhythmias. However, muscle rigidity and altered mental status would not be expected.

E. Ischemic infarction of the cerebellum (1%)

(Choice D) Although infection should be considered in this postoperative patient with fever and leukocytosis, her labile hypertension (vs hypotension more commonly seen in sepsis), increased muscle tone, and tremor make NMS more likely. In addition, her urinalysis shows no evidence of infection (negative nitrites, 1-2 white blood cells/hpf), and deep joint infections without overlying skin breakdown are unlikely in the ﬁrst few postoperative days.

Although infarction can be accompanied by autonomic dysregulation if the lateral medulla is also affected, increased muscle tone, fever, and altered mental status would not be expected.

Educational objective:

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is characterized by severe muscular rigidity, mental status changes, autonomic dysregulation, and fever. Dopamine antagonism, which occurs with the use of most antipsychotics, has been implicated as a primary cause of NMS.

A 19-year-old college student comes to the emergency department due to a 1-week history of malaise, fever, and a painful right knee that he says, "I probably just hurt playing football." He has no other symptoms and reports that he has been studying hard and looking forward to an upcoming football game. The patient has a history of depression that is currently treated with ﬂuoxetine. His family history is signiﬁcant for diabetes mellitus in his father. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 12/min. Physical examination shows a swollen, hot right knee joint that is tender to palpation with a restricted range of motion. The patient is informed about the need for a joint aspiration for possible septic arthritis but refuses, saying, "I prefer not to have anything done with needles; I'll take pain medication and just get some rest." The physician counsels him about the risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives to the aspiration and explains that he can be given a local anesthetic to numb the pain. The patient reports understanding the information but continues to refuse the procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Correct answer

Explanation

There is a very high probability that this patient has septic arthritis, and joint aspiration and ﬂuid analysis are essential to correctly diagnose and treat him. If he refuses the procedure, the ﬁrst step is to address any issues regarding why he does not want to proceed. If the patient still refuses, he should be allowed to leave based on the principle of autonomy. Patients who have decision-making capacity (are able to understand the risks and beneﬁts of treatment and express a choice) have the right to refuse treatment. The physician should still offer the services and inform the patient that he can always return for diagnosis and treatment.

(Choice A) If the situation is an emergency and a patient is incapacitated and cannot make a decision (eg, is unconscious), presumed consent is enough to proceed. However, if a patient has decision-making capacity, this must be respected.

(Choices C and E) This patient is not a minor and has a right to conﬁdentiality; threatening to call his parents or calling his coach without permission is unethical and a violation of the physician-patient relationship. The parents or coach could be contacted with permission of the

patient.

(Choice D) A psychiatry consult would be indicated if the physician believed that the patient's depression could affect his decision-making capacity. However, this patient's depression is adequately treated with medication and there is no evidence that it is inﬂuencing his decision.

Educational objective:

Patients who have decision-making capacity have the right to refuse procedures and treatment. The physician should address any modiﬁable obstacles to treatment. If the patient still refuses, services should be offered if the patient reconsiders.

In a patient who has been hospitalized for 72 hours, the onset of acute change in cognition and attention, tachycardia, hypertension, tremulousness, diaphoresis, agitation, and hallucinations should raise suspicion for delirium tremens (DT) due to alcohol withdrawal.

Chronic alcohol use results in insensitivity to GABA, the neurotransmitter principally responsible for maintaining inhibitory tone. In contrast, a prolonged decrease in or cessation of alcohol intake leads to disequilibrium between inhibition and excitation, favoring excitation of the central, somatic, and autonomic nervous systems.

DT is a late complication of alcohol withdrawal that may affect up to 5% of patients who experience an initial milder withdrawal syndrome. DT does not present before 48 hours after the last drink, but symptoms may take as long as 96 hours to be seen. These symptoms may persist for up to 5 days and are associated with a mortality rate of up to 5%.

Treatment of DT is similar to milder forms of alcohol withdrawal in that benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, diazepam) are the pharmacologic treatment of choice; however, the treatment of DT invariably requires intensive care unit-level supportive management.

Answered correctly

(Choice A) Abdominal compartment syndrome presents with wide-ranging organ dysfunction (eg, decreased cardiac output, increased intracranial pressure, renal impairment) in patients

with increased intra-abdominal pressure secondary to large-volume resuscitation, burns, or other abdominal conditions (eg, ascites, liver transplantation).

(Choice B) Patients with an exacerbation of schizophrenia are typically not disoriented. This

A 39-year-old woman is hospitalized for appendicitis and undergoes an appendectomy on

hospital day 1. The patient has an uncomplicated postoperative course until the morning of hospital day 3, when she suddenly becomes acutely agitated. She tries to get out of bed and shouts, "Get your hands off me! God is watching!" when the nurses try to redirect her back into bed. The patient has a history of schizophrenia, hypertension, multiple substance use disorders, and homelessness. Medical records indicate that she was treated for a heroin and cocaine overdose last year and has had multiple admissions related to her substance use. Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F), blood pressure is 171/95 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 18/min. The patient is oriented only to person. She is diaphoretic, but the remainder of the examination is limited due to agitation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?

(Choice B) Patients with an exacerbation of schizophrenia are typically not disoriented. This patient's agitation and bizarre statements may be inﬂuenced by the psychopathology of schizophrenia, but her disorientation, elevated vital signs, and overall clinical picture are better explained by DT.

(Choice D) Cocaine intoxication may present with euphoria; autonomic hyperactivity (eg, tachycardia, hypertension); and, at higher doses, psychosis. This patient's delirium, timing of symptom onset, and overall clinical picture are more consistent with alcohol withdrawal.

(Choice E) Malignant hyperthermia is characterized by rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, and tachycardia immediately following the administration of succinylcholine or a volatile inhaled anesthetic (eg, halothane, sevoﬂurane) in susceptible individuals (susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern).

• A. Abdominal compartment syndrome (0%)

• B. Acute schizophrenia exacerbation (3%)

• C. Alcohol withdrawal (68%).

• D. Cocaine intoxication (5%)

(Choice F) The timing of opioid withdrawal depends on the half-life of the speciﬁc opioid being used (eg, heroin withdrawal begins approximately 12 hours after last use) and consists of gastrointestinal distress, myalgias, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis, and mild elevations of heart rate and blood pressure. The onset of symptoms after 48 hours, delirium, and severity of this patient's elevated vital signs are more consistent with alcohol withdrawal and DT.

E. Malignant hyperthermia (4%)

(Choice G) Postoperative encephalopathy is most commonly associated with cardiac surgery and presents with delirium and/or seizures in the immediate postoperative period.

• F. Opioid withdrawal (12%)

• G. Postoperative encephalopathy (4%)

• H. Pulmonary embolism (0%)

(Choice H) Pulmonary embolism may present in the postoperative period with dyspnea and chest pain.

Delirium tremens is a late manifestation of alcohol withdrawal that is characterized by delirium, hyperthermia, hypertension, and tachycardia 48-96 hours after the last drink. Delirium tremens is associated with a mortality rate of 5% and requires aggressive intensive care unit-level supportive management in addition to benzodiazepine therapy.
